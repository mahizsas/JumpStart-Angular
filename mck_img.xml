But to keep pace, these companies will also need to understand the economic, societal, and demographic changes shaping the profiles of consumers and the way they spend. This is no easy task not only because of the fast pace of growth and subsequent changes in the Chinese way of life but also because of the vast economic and demographic differences across the country. </p><p>
These differences are set to become more marked, with significant implications for companies that fail to grasp them. Since 2005, McKinsey has conducted annual consumer surveys in China, interviewing a total of more than 60,000 people in upward of 60 cities.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote1' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote1' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
The latest survey, carried out in 2011, gauged Chinese consumers’ attitudes and spending behavior for about 60 product types and 300 brands. The respondents—representing a wide range of incomes, ages, regions, and cities—accounted for 74 percent of China’s total GDP and 47 percent of the total population. 
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> Our surveys have tracked the growth of incomes, shifting patterns of expenditure, rising expectations—sometimes in line with those of the respondents’ Western counterparts and sometimes not—and the development of many different consumer segments. Those surveys now provide insights to help us focus on the future. We cannot, of course, predict it with certainty, and external shocks might confound any forecast. But our understanding of consumer trends to date, coupled with an analysis of the economic and demographic factors that will further shape them in the next decade, serve as a useful lens for contemplating the profile of the Chinese consumer in 2020.</p><!--roadblock--><h3>Changing demographics</h3><p>
Many of the changes taking place in China are common features of rapid industrialization: rising incomes, urban living, better education, postponed life stages, and greater mobility. Japan saw similar changes in the 1950s and 1960s, as did South Korea and Taiwan in the 1980s. </p><p>
But some unique factors are also at work, such as the government’s one-child policy and the marked economic imbalances among regions. Our analysis reveals important insights into the likely demographic and socio-demographic profiles of Chinese consumers at the end of this decade.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote2' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>2</sup></a> <span id='footnote2' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>2.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
We focus on urban consumers in this report.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span></p><p>
Changes in economic profiles have been and will continue to be the most important trend shaping the consumer landscape. The Chinese are certainly getting richer fast: the per-household disposable income<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote3' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>3</sup></a> <span id='footnote3' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>3.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
Urban-household disposable income—the combined disposable income of all members of a household—is defined as total household income minus income taxes and contributions to social security.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> of urban consumers will double between 2010 and 2020, from about $4,000 to about $8,000.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote4' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>4</sup></a> <span id='footnote4' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>4.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
 In 2010 real terms for all dollar and renminbi figures in this article, unless stated otherwise.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> That will be close to South Korea’s current standard of living but still a long way from its level in some developed countries, such as the United States (about $35,000) and Japan (about $26,000). </p><p>
The current vast differences in income levels will persist, however, although the numbers at each level will shift dramatically (Exhibit 1). At present, the great majority of the population consists of “value” consumers—those living in households with annual disposable incomes between $6,000 and $16,000 (equivalent to 37,000 to 106,000 renminbi), just enough to cover basic needs. “Mainstream” consumers, relatively well-to-do households with annual disposable income of between $16,000 and $34,000 (equivalent to 106,000 to 229,000 renminbi), form a very small group by comparison. China has fewer than 14 million such households, representing only 6 percent of the urban population. A tiny group of “affluent” consumers, whose household income exceeds $34,000, accounts for only 2 percent of the urban population, or 4.26 million households.</p>

    <p>
Until now, these divergences have presented multinational companies operating in China with a choice: to target only mainstream and affluent consumers or to stretch the brand to serve the value segment. Those that took the first course could more or less maintain the same business model they applied in other parts of the world, without needing to de-engineer their products. But in taking that approach, they limited themselves to a target market of 18 million households. Companies that chose to serve the value category benefitted from a much bigger market to play in—184 million households—but their products had to be cheaper, they were forced to adapt their business models, and profitability was lower. </p><p>
This situation is changing. Because the wealth of so many consumers is rising so rapidly, many people in the value category will have joined the mainstream one by 2020. Indeed, mainstream consumers will then account for 51 percent of the urban population. Their absolute level of wealth will remain quite low compared with that of consumers in developed countries. Yet this group, comprising 167 million households (close to 400 million people), will become the standard setters for consumption, capable of affording family cars and small luxury items. Companies will be able to respond by introducing better products to a vast group of new consumers, thus differentiating themselves from competitors and earning higher profits. Nevertheless, value consumers, whose ranks will fall to 36 percent of urban households in 2020, from 82 percent in 2010, will still represent an enormous market for cheaper products: 116 million households, or 307 million consumers.</p><p>
Affluent consumers will remain an elite minority, making up only 6 percent of the population in 2020. (In the United States in 2010, more than half of the population earned at least $34,000.) But that 6 percent will translate into about 21 million affluent households, with 60 million consumers.</p><p>
While income is expected to rise across China, some cities and regions are already significantly wealthier than others. Understanding these variations in the rate of development is important because they will affect which categories of goods and services grow most rapidly, and where.</p><p>
Today, about 85 percent of mainstream consumers live in the 100 wealthiest cities; in the next 300 wealthiest, only 10 percent of consumers are mainstream, but that percentage will rise to nearly 30 percent by 2020. At that point, many families in these cities will be able to afford a range of goods and services (such as flat-screen televisions and overseas travel) that are now largely confined to the wealthiest urban areas. Exhibit 2 explains the distribution of income in four different groups of cities. Some of them (Foshan in Guangdong, for example) are small in terms of absolute GDP or population size. But it’s worth noting that the affluence of their populations could make them as attractive to companies as leading tier-one cities, such as Shanghai and Shenzhen. </p>

    <h3>New spending patterns</h3><p>
An understanding of China’s changing economics and its impact on the profiles of consumers helps to identify some key trends in spending patterns in the next decade. We discuss three: high growth in discretionary categories, the tendency to trade up as consumers spend some of their discretionary income on better goods and services, and the emergence of a senior market.</p><h3 class="sm black">Higher discretionary spending</h3><p>
Bigger incomes and government efforts to increase consumption will benefit all consumer-facing companies, though to varying degrees, depending on their product portfolios. Discretionary categories will show the strongest overall growth—13.4 percent—between 2010 and 2020, as these goods become affordable to growing numbers of consumers. Next come semi-necessities (10.9 percent growth) followed by necessities (7.2 percent). These average figures will of course vary significantly by region and city.</p><p>
Exhibit 3 shows forecast annual consumption by category for 2020 and the rising importance of discretionary spending. Each broad category includes subcategories, some of which are more discretionary than others and expected to grow faster. For example, a discretionary category within food—dining out—is expected to grow by 10.2 percent a year in the coming decade, against 7.2 percent growth for basic food ingredients.</p> 
    <div id="v3">
      <h4>Exhibit 3</h4>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>Discretionary spending is expected to grow considerably by 2020.</p>
      <div>
        <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/tools/Wrappers/Wrapper.aspx?sid={E2D88CD9-B2B5-465A-A3D8-38574D8A3659}&amp;pid={7F4DBFBC-A2D2-4D4F-A86E-C3457F737A06}">
          <img src="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/dotcom/Insights/Asia-Pacific/Meet the Chinese consumer of 2020/svgz_Web_ChinaConsumer_ex3.ashx">
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
Of course, the wealthiest people—those in our affluent segment—will be the main consumers of discretionary items. Less obvious is the <i>extent</i> to which they will be able to afford more such items in 2020, compared with people in other income groups, as their numbers and wealth grow. Our consumption model suggests that in 2010, average household spending for value, mainstream, and affluent consumers was about $2,000, $4,000, and $12,000, respectively. These figures will jump to $3,000, $6,000, and $21,000, respectively, by 2020. So although all consumers will increase their spending, the gaps between different income groups will widen significantly. Stark disparities in standards of living are emerging in China. </p><h3 class="sm black">Aspirational trading up</h3><p>
The second noticeable trend in spending is a propensity to trade up, driven increasingly by consumers aspiring to improve themselves, the way they live, and their perceived social standing. Many Chinese, like their Western counterparts, judge themselves and others by what they buy.</p><p>
Strong early growth in developing markets comes when large numbers of consumers try products for the first time. As markets mature, growth relies on consumers who buy more goods and services more frequently and trade up to buy pricier versions of items they already have. This pattern explains why some basic-necessity categories have little room for growth: many consumers can already afford such items and probably won’t buy a great deal more of them. But that does not mean no growth at all. Take the market for sauces and condiments. Most people can already afford to buy as much as they need of these items. But the increased attention now paid to health and well-being shows that even here, companies have trading-up opportunities. </p><p>
Such opportunities also exist within semi-necessity categories, such as apparel, health care, and household products: more consumers will be able to afford different outfits for different occasions, for instance, or to buy additional branded products. As a consequence, brands focused on mass-market consumers might need to be repositioned to suit their rising aspirations, while newer, younger brands may be able to leapfrog more established competitors by offering premium products and crafting a premium brand image.</p><p>
But it is the top end of the market that will benefit most from trading up: growth at the high end of some consumer goods categories already outpaces average growth for those categories as a whole. Sales of premium skin care products, for instance, rose by more than 20 percent a year in the past decade while the industry average was 10 percent.</p><p>
Annual volume growth rates of more than 20 percent are foreseeable for luxury SUV cars, compared with around 10 percent for basic family models. China had already become a leading luxury market by 2010 and could overtake Japan to become the biggest such market by 2015.</p><h3 class="sm black">Emerging senior market</h3><p>
The aging of China means that as a share of the total population, it will have five percentage points more people above the age of 65 in 2020 than it has today. That is an extra 126.5 million citizens, clearly an important consumer segment. What is equally important is the way the spending patterns of older people in 2020 will differ from those of older people now. In our 2011 survey, the elderly were more inclined to save and less willing to spend on discretionary items such as travel, leisure, and nice clothes. These tendencies will probably be much less apparent in 2020.</p><p>
Most people in China over the age of 55 experienced the harsh conditions of the Cultural Revolution, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Not surprisingly, they think it important not to spend frivolously. Among residents of tier-one cities, 55- to 65-year-olds allocate half of their spending to food and little to discretionary categories: only 7 percent goes toward apparel, for example. People who are ten years younger devote only 38 percent of their spending to food but 13 percent to apparel. Indeed, our consumer surveys have revealed that although today’s older consumers behave very differently from younger ones, today’s 45- to 54-year-olds—the older generation come 2020—have spending patterns similar to those of 34- to 45-year-olds (who allocate 34 percent of their spending to food and 14 percent to apparel). This finding implies that companies will have to rethink their ideas about what older Chinese consumers want.</p><h3>Implications for companies</h3><p>
The biggest challenge is building and sustaining a leading position in China and, for multinationals, using it to drive global growth. In fact, as the country with the world’s largest group of mainstream consumers, it could be an excellent test bed for companies that serve this consumer segment. Our analysis indicates that huge variations in the growth rates of companies operating in China come 2020 are likely, depending on the product category, consumer segment, and geography.</p><p>
A second challenge is that China is so vast and its regions so diverse it should be treated almost as a collection of separate countries. Companies should redefine the roles of their regional divisions and headquarters, delegating more decision-making power to the former. Many companies already operate with three, five, or even more regional bases, but these tend to function only as sales offices, executing instructions from the top. Consumer needs could become so varied across China’s regions that local insight and strategic decision-making power will be vital. Regional offices should therefore receive full responsibility for their own profit-and-loss accounts, strategic planning, consumer research, innovations, portfolios, route-to-market models, and marketing. The corporate center should have a redefined role—serving the individual units and safeguarding the company’s brands—with less power and at a lower overhead cost.</p><p>
A third challenge stems from the fact that undifferentiated mass consumption and the rising cost of ads made the scale of a brand or product crucial to its success in the past decade. Companies provided the same value proposition—usually framed around a product’s functional benefits—to all types of consumers, while stretching brands across product categories and price tiers to leverage scale and garner market share. Over the next decade, the game will change to take account of the emergence of different categories of consumers and their own sense of their differences and individuality. Companies will need the crispest value propositions to connect with each group and to stand out from competitors. By 2020, they will have to position brands (or sub-brands) to target narrower consumer segments and offer more tailored value propositions. Brands extended across too many consumer segments and price points may struggle to defend their market position. Hard though the transition could be, at some point companies that have focused on maximizing their brands’ scale will have to adopt a model based on a portfolio of more targeted brands or sub-brands to connect with different consumer segments.</p><p>
No doubt China and its consumers’ behavior will take some unexpected turns over the next decade. Nonetheless, our research reveals the clear direction of travel. To be sure of taking part in that journey, companies in the market should start making the acquaintance of China’s 2020 consumers today.<br /></p><p><i>Read</i> <a href="http://www.mckinseychina.com/2012/03/07/meet-the-2020-chinese-consumer" target="_blank">Meet the 2020 Chinese consumer</a>, <i>the full report on which this article is based, on the McKinsey Greater China Web site.</i></p><div class="about-authors"><h3 class="sm black">About the authors</h3><p><b>Yuval Atsmon</b> is a principal in McKinsey’s Shanghai office, and <b>Max Magni</b> is a principal in the Hong Kong office.</p>

      <title>Winning strategies for China’s financial-services sector</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/financial_services/winning_strategies_for_chinas_financial-services_sector"/><p><strong>China&rsquo;s financial-services industry</strong> has grown quite rapidly over the past decade&mdash;product offerings, talent pools, and sales channels are increasing in scale and quality across sectors. With so many new opportunities available, companies raced to capture market share in many segments and products. Today, the industry&rsquo;s prospects in China remain attractive, and much more alluring than they are almost anywhere else. However, financial-services firms there now face a decade of transformation in which they must adapt to structural shifts ranging from new customer demands to the market&rsquo;s maturation. To win in changing times, these firms must refocus on profits and customer service.</p>
<p>To provide guidance on the evolving Chinese landscape, McKinsey&rsquo;s financial-services practice is releasing a series of reports that discuss major trends and strategic priorities. <!--roadblock-->The first three reports discuss the following sectors: </p>
<ul class="leftContentUL">
    <li>
    <p><strong>Retail banking.</strong> China&rsquo;s retail-banking market holds great potential for the future&mdash;in fact, it is poised to become the world&rsquo;s second largest by 2015. Recognizing the opportunity, Chinese retail banks have concentrated over the past decade on increasing scale rather than profitability. But as <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx.ashx">Next-generation retail banking in China: Building eight transformational capabilities</a></em> (PDF&ndash;915KB) argues, this business model isn&rsquo;t sustainable. Banks are now under more pressure to increase returns on assets and customer satisfaction. In some segments, such as the credit-card market in major cities, penetration has reached the point where substantial growth is no longer attainable solely by acquiring new customers. Retail banks won&rsquo;t win in this market unless they shift emphasis to improving profit per customer. That change will force them to focus on three objectives: building better primary relationships with customers, creating smarter and more focused acquisition strategies, and developing low-cost and scalable operating models.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

    <div id="v3">
      <h4>Exhibit</h4>
      <h3></h3>
      <p>China will become the second-largest retail-banking market in the world by 2015, with an annual revenue pool of around $280 billion by 2020.</p>

          <img src="">
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
    
<ul class="leftContentUL">
    <li>
    <p><strong>Securities markets.</strong> After several near-death experiences two years ago, leading securities firms strengthened their capital ratios and adjusted their business and economic models to restore profitability. There is still much room for improvement, however, as <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/008092D00CCE446EBF2EE5C997D1FB28.ashx">The next decade of innovation and transformation in China&rsquo;s securities industry</a></em> (PDF&ndash;916KB) demonstrates. Most firms still provide their retail and institutional customers with a limited range of commoditized services focused on cash execution. Their business models help them perform well during boom markets but are inadequate during downturns. In the future, winning firms will provide broader, more differentiated offerings to remain relevant&mdash;for example, personal advisory services for high-net-worth individuals, prime-brokerage products, or deep market insights for institutional investors. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Life insurance.</strong> Although China&rsquo;s life-insurance market slowed in 2012, significant gains could materialize in the future given the emergence of the country&rsquo;s middle class, rapid urbanization, and an aging population. <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/C59B94751A8F41FFBDF136DFC3E46C32.ashx">Growth under uncertainty: Trends, issues, and outlook of China&rsquo;s life insurance industry</a></em> (PDF&ndash;8,520KB) describes how companies can capture new opportunities by undertaking a holistic transformation touching every aspect of their business. In addition to revitalizing traditional sales channels (agents and bancassurance), companies must expand their product mix and create more offerings that focus on the core value proposition of life insurance: guaranteeing income for survivors. Finally, they must put more emphasis on customer needs throughout the entire product life cycle&mdash;marketing, packaging, distribution, and product design.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Across all three sectors, the challenges that lie ahead may seem daunting. But as the financial sector continues its transformation in a more mature and complex market, one thing is certain: firms will be at a disadvantage if they don&rsquo;t make difficult decisions about their strategies and business models now.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/AA8A7CAD5BD343AD904CBC735EB2FBA5.ashx">Winning strategies for US asset managers</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> How is the role of IT changing at Coca-Cola, and, with it, your role as CIO?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> IT and marketing are very close partners at Coca-Cola today&mdash;more so, I think, than at most other companies&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the way it should be. Coke is spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year on digital marketing, and that number will, no doubt, continue to rise. Almost all of that spending is IT-related. This development calls for a broader CIO role. It&rsquo;s not enough to be an operational back-office CIO running the systems. It&rsquo;s also not enough to be a process CIO reinventing the supply chain and transforming support functions. Important as those two roles are, they need to be complemented by what I call the revenue-generator CIO or business-level CIO.</p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> What were the beginnings of the strategic partnership between marketing and IT at Coca-Cola?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> Our marketers started to think more seriously about digital channels five years ago or so. As mobile adoption expanded, they started to build a direct connection with our customers by pushing mobile applications for social-media sites and our loyalty programs, such as My Coke Rewards.</p>
<p>
Marketing was driving a lot of it through its own advertising and digital agencies while IT, at the time, was struggling to be relevant. We were viewed as a back-office function, not as one of the strategic leaders and partners in our digital-marketing efforts. I believed we should be bringing ideas to marketing instead of marketing coming to us for creative solutions and more often than not getting the answer, &ldquo;Sorry. We don&rsquo;t have the people to do these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Our first step was simply to offer traditional operating, hosting, and security for the sites and platforms the agencies were building. We did that quite well and now have over 600 consumer sites hosted in one platform environment with great data protection.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> What did it take to get to the level of business partner, to get to the point, for example, where you were coming up with cool mobile apps and connecting them with consumer-relationship programs?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> It&rsquo;s all about people. Just like Coca-Cola&rsquo;s marketing organization, which hired some really smart people in the field of digital and interactive marketing, we started to recruit talented IT people who were more entrepreneurial, a little more strategic in their thinking, and who connected better with what marketing was trying to achieve. As one example, my enterprise architect is based in Silicon Valley with his team&mdash;closer to where the solutions are likely to come from.</p>
<p>
That said, we still have some way to go when it comes to getting young people with a different kind of mind-set. We used to bring in 35 IT interns each year, but we hired none of them despite the great work they did, because our focus was on seasoned hires, for example, business and systems analysts and project managers. We certainly must have experienced people for big systems applications and the like, but for application-development work using software as a service, an entry-level hire may be just fine.</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re now hiring five of our interns each year, and it&rsquo;s amazing what they can do. They look at the world differently, and they come up with new answers. They help us build a new culture in which IT is a better business partner. It will take years to complete this cultural shift, but it will only happen if we address the people side of it.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> What is the IT department doing today to cultivate direct consumer relationships?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> Recently, for the 2012 Summer Olympics, we created mobile applications tailored for over 100 countries and available in the Android and iPhone stores, in order to create a digital-marketing event around the globe that boosted our impact well beyond our traditional sponsorship and television advertising channels. The IT department built some of the applications and managed others created by external agencies or our consumers. When content comes from thousands and thousands of sources, it requires a complete ecosystem. We&rsquo;re now running content-management systems, digital-rights-management systems, digital-access-management systems, and mobile-distribution systems. Packaging content and distributing it around the world is a very big area for us right now. Today, digital marketing is a joint activity in our company, with marketing in many cases looking directly to us for better ways to reach our customers.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> Having demand-driven supply-chain systems is a trend in consumer packaged goods. What is Coca-Cola doing in this field?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> It&rsquo;s a very important area for Coca-Cola. We&rsquo;ve been working hard the last couple of years to integrate our plant and distribution systems to make it possible for us to see exactly what&rsquo;s happening with our products as they move through the supply chain. One critical benefit is to ensure that we can minimize out-of-stocks. Imagine that we direct our Facebook fans to a local outlet with a targeted promotion and the product isn&rsquo;t available. We&rsquo;ve lost a sale and had a negative impact on relationships with our consumers. The inventory at the back of a store is pretty visible, but we lose track at the shelf point and the cooler point. We&rsquo;re experimenting with some interesting methods to fill that gap, such as radio-frequency identification and electronic tagging of our products.</p>
<p>
Interestingly, we have a pretty cool solution to this in the United Kingdom, where we have merchandisers take pictures of our shelves and coolers when they come into stores to talk about orders, promotions, and so on. We spent a lot of time trying to automate the processing of information found in the photographs, but it turned out that a better solution was to send the photos to a company in India: its staff studies the shots and in less than a minute gets back to us with stock counts of each product. It&rsquo;s a nice blend of technology and human process. Is there a better solution? We&rsquo;re still experimenting.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> What is the best example of IT&rsquo;s new role at Coca-Cola?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> Coca-Cola Freestyle, our revolutionary fountain dispenser, integrates most of what the IT department is up to and also points the way toward a technology-driven future for beverages that might be quite different from the present landscape. Earlier fountains were basically mechanical machines. Coca-Cola Freestyle is effectively a complex and sensitive enterprise-resource-planning environment. A computer embedded in the new fountain machine calculates with surgical precision the ingredients of over 100 different beverage brands. To begin, consumers experiment a bit with various brands until they find one they really like. When they do, we find that they come back to our fountains for that particular drink and this leads to increased same-store sales.</p>
<p>
The computer records all the data involved in every single pour. Each fountain knows when it&rsquo;s running low on certain products. We are also using automated ordering in many Coca-Cola Freestyle locations whereby the fountain can build its own orders for supplies and place them directly into the system. It would even optimize the order so that you pay the lowest possible delivered cost. There are other things we can do with the operational data, such as working with the owner of the fountain location to talk about, for example, what drinks are moving at certain times of the day and, as a result, potential opportunities to adjust pricing and promotions. Broader marketing data represent another area. Is there, for example, a particular drink that happens to be selling really well in a particular region, country, or city?</p>
<p>
We have visions of how we will use the data as we deploy thousands and thousands of the machines in locations such as restaurant chains, entertainment venues, and retail stores. We&rsquo;ve got 50 million&ndash;plus fans on Facebook. We&rsquo;ve got some 18 million people on My Coke Rewards. If we could bring these audiences together around Coca-Cola Freestyle, we could learn some really cool things.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> A final question, what&rsquo;s your advice to a CIO starting out in the consumer-packaged-goods industry?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> My advice is that there&rsquo;s an interesting shift going on in the world of consumer packaged goods, and IT has to stay very close to the new trends if it wants to be relevant. If you&rsquo;re comfortable being an operational CIO you&rsquo;ll still be needed, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to help your company grow as fast as it could.</p>

      <title>How to choose the right nonexecutive board leader</title>
      <description>It’s time to use a structured process for selecting the nonexecutive leader of the board. Defining the role is a good start.</description>

<p>The change in governance followed corporate scandals (in the early part of the decade) that led to investor pressures to strengthen corporate governance by separating the roles of CEO and chairman. This separation represented a step into the unknown, because the CEO traditionally served as chairman in most US companies and was the board&rsquo;s undisputed leader. The combined role of CEO and chairman is still very common, but the governance structure at most Fortune 100 companies<a href="#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span style="display: none;" id="footnote1" class="tooltip"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> According to <i>Agenda</i>&rsquo;s 2009 board leadership guide, of the 96 Fortune 100 public companies included in the research, 43.8 percent had a presiding director and 37.5 percent a lead director. The most common governance structure in the largest US companies combined the positions of chairman and CEO and complemented this with a presiding director. For more, see <a href="http://agendaweek.com" target="_blank">agendaweek.com</a>. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>has now been complemented by a presiding or lead director, who plays a substantial role in leading the board&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>To examine how the new board leader role has evolved, and the best practices for appointing one, we invited 11 current and former board leaders of large US companies to share their views and experiences (see sidebar, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s who&rdquo;). One of their insights was that there is little difference in how their companies utilize the board leader whether the organization refers to that person as a presiding or lead director or as a nonexecutive chairman, although a few interviewees saw the latter title as having more importance symbolically. These board leaders spoke of a role that has grown beyond mandated process requirements, to carry a more substantive meaning for the creation of corporate value. At many leading companies today, the board leader is a real partner of the CEO on strategy issues and has taken over or partnered with the CEO on some functions the chief executive has historically led, such as setting board agendas, recruiting new directors, and more aggressively assessing risk.</p>

<p>Our panel also noted how the process of selecting a board leader has been evolving from an unstructured and haphazard approach toward one that should ideally resemble the best practices for CEO succession. The board leaders we interviewed agreed, without exception, that good board succession planning starts with producing a formal document that specifies the duties and the personal characteristics the board leader should have, even though they may change over time. This document could also be used for evaluating the board leader from time to time.</p>
<p>Based on our interviews and experience of serving on corporate boards, we believe that the leader&rsquo;s duties should ideally include chairing executive sessions, board meetings in the absence of the chairman (when the CEO has that role too), and meetings of the independent directors when necessary, as well as presiding over the board evaluation process to ensure that the board functions effectively. The duties should also involve frequent cooperation with the CEO in communicating with shareholders and external stakeholders, working with board committee chairmen (for example, on the CEO&rsquo;s evaluation and compensation), and acting as a liaison between the board and management. What&rsquo;s more, the board leader should ensure that a succession plan is in place for the CEO and the board leader, as well as work in partnership with the CEO on strategy issues.</p>
<p>Every one of the interviewees emphasized the need for close collaboration and trusted communication with the CEO and fellow directors to help the board navigate the challenges of a complex business environment and to focus boardroom discussions on strategy and overall value creation. Some interviewees discussed the need for the board leader to facilitate the evaluation of the board&rsquo;s performance and, if needed, to deal with problem directors. Most interviewees believed that &ldquo;firing a director&rdquo; should be a process led by the board leader, based on peer- and/or self-assessments.</p>
<p>Given the focus on meetings and conversations, many directors in our panel stressed that the board leader must be a superb facilitator. &ldquo;A skilled board leader can wring a lot out of these discussions,&rdquo; said Jim Cullen, the lead director of Johnson &amp; Johnson and nonexecutive chairman of Agilent Technologies. And this function &ldquo;lies at the heart of what a board leader can bring to the governance process and to the successful strategic momentum of the business.&rdquo; Doing one&rsquo;s homework on the business is also key. &ldquo;You have to stay current [and] understand the priorities of the business, the strategy, and the direction of the business, especially if you are going to have candid one-on-one discussions with the CEO,&rdquo; Cullen said.</p>
<p>When Jack Krol became the lead director at Tyco International, in 2003, he developed, in conjunction with CEO Edward Breen, a document specifying his own role. With input from the board, the governance committee then developed some general characteristics of the role for whoever would succeed Krol in the future. Krol said three competencies or characteristics were deemed most critical.</p>
<p>First, Krol said, &ldquo;the ideal candidate has to have stature with the other directors and be seen as a leader in the boardroom.&rdquo; Krol also noted that &ldquo;the ideal board leader is an engaged and thoughtful director. This candidate adds value during board deliberations, with significant comments when compared to others who may talk more but, over time, indicate a lack of substance&rdquo;&mdash;adding that &ldquo;you just know it when you see it.&rdquo; Second, &ldquo;the candidate must have compatibility with the CEO as well as good chemistry, and the person should not be adversarial.&rdquo; Third, &ldquo;the candidate must express interest and have the time to do the job.&rdquo; Krol added, &ldquo;at Tyco I was involved nearly every day for a year during the crisis, either at a company location or on the phone.&rdquo; (Krol was referring to Tyco&rsquo;s 2002 financial woes, which were compounded by accounting scandals involving its former CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski.) Indeed, many of the directors we interviewed underlined that boards should select leaders with the assumption that at some stage during their tenure, the company would be under some form of stress or in a crisis.</p>
<p>Advance planning and a well-vetted description of the role were essential when Krol recently handed over the reins as lead director to fellow Tyco International director Bruce Gordon. Krol, now nonexecutive chairman of Delphi, knew the stakes were high. If he and Tyco International&rsquo;s board hadn&rsquo;t found a successor capable of carrying on the dynamic created by the board and CEO Edward Breen, that failure might have unraveled years of progress in transforming the company&rsquo;s governance in the eyes of shareholders and employees alike. The process was conducted over several months. The governance committee developed a list of three Tyco directors who best met the selection criteria and then conducted discussions, led by Krol, with each candidate and the CEO. Ultimately, an executive session of the board made the selection, based on the committee&rsquo;s recommendation. The process, not unlike one that should be used to evaluate inside candidates for the job of CEO, enabled the board to engage in a thoughtful, well-paced process to arrive at the right answer.</p>
<p>The smooth succession at Tyco exemplifies best rather than common practice. Few of the companies in our sample had a formal specification for the board leader position when the time came to pass the baton, but all believed that such a specification should be created for the next &ldquo;baton pass.&rdquo; We find there is an increasing number of companies whose board leader says his or her board intends to develop a better profile of the ideal leader and then goes after the right candidate based on the formal specification rather than requiring candidates to compete with only nebulous criteria as their guide.</p>
<p>The old method of picking a successor wouldn&rsquo;t stand up in today&rsquo;s governance environment, noted Harold A. (&ldquo;Hap&rdquo;) Wagner, who was lead director at United Technologies for five years. Wagner recalls that when it was time for him to step down, in 2008, there was no document specifying the criteria for the selection of his successor. &ldquo;Today, the position of lead director has been much more magnified,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suspect that there is a specification now for lead director at UTC, and, if not, there should be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>The board leader role has come a long way and is still evolving. What works best for one company may not necessarily fit another, because of varying degrees of business success, different cultures, and unique personal chemistry on the board. However, the common themes and recommendations uncovered by our research might help to shape the outlook of all boards when the time comes to pick a new board leader. </p>

But when we meet with the men and women who run the world&rsquo;s largest organizations, what we hear with increasing frequency is how different everything feels from just a decade ago. Leaders tell us they are operating in a bewildering new environment in which little is certain, the tempo is quicker, and the dynamics are more complex. They worry that it is impossible for chief executives to stay on top of all the things they need to know to do their job. Some admit they feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>To understand the leadership challenge of our volatile, globalized, hyperconnected age more clearly, we recently initiated a series of structured interviews with the leaders of some of the world&rsquo;s largest and most vibrant organizations. Excerpts from six of those conversations appear below. The leaders&mdash;Josef Ackermann, formerly of Deutsche Bank; Carlos Ghosn of Nissan and Renault; Moya Greene of Royal Mail Group; Ellen Kullman of DuPont; President Shimon Peres of Israel; and Daniel Vasella of Novartis (see sidebar, &ldquo;Leaders on leadership&rdquo;)&mdash;represent a diverse array of viewpoints. All are grappling with today&rsquo;s environment in different ways. But the common themes that emerged from these conversations&mdash;what it means to lead in an age of upheaval, to master personal challenges, to be in the limelight continually, to make decisions under extreme uncertainty&mdash;offer a useful starting point for understanding today&rsquo;s leadership landscape.</p>

<p>After presenting the ideas of these leaders on leadership, we offer a few additional reflections on the topic. They draw in part on the interviews, as well as on our experiences with clients; on conversations with dozens of experts in academia, government, and the private sector; and on our review of the extensive academic and popular literature on the subject. All reinforce our belief that today&rsquo;s leaders face extraordinary new challenges and must learn to think differently about their role and how to fulfill it. Those who do may have an opportunity to change the world in ways their predecessors never imagined.</p>

<h3>Leading in an age of upheaval</h3>
<p><em>A convergence of forces is reshaping the global economy: emerging regions, such as Africa, Brazil, China, and India, have overtaken economies in the West as engines of global growth; the pace of innovation is increasing exponentially; new technologies have created new industries, disrupted old ones, and spawned communication networks of astonishing speed; and global emergencies seem to erupt at ever-shorter intervals. Any one of these developments would have profound implications for organizations and the people who lead them. Taken together, these forces are creating a new context for leadership.</em></p>
<p><strong>Josef Ackermann:</strong> We experienced a tremendous shift in the global balance of power, which manifests itself in our business. In the 1980s, over 80 percent of Deutsche Bank revenues were generated in Germany. In the mid-1990s, they still accounted for about 70 percent. Today, Germany, despite its continuing economic strength, stands for 38 percent of global revenues. Over the years, people in our headquarters, in Frankfurt, started complaining to me, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see you much around here anymore.&rdquo; Well, there was a reason why: growth has moved elsewhere&mdash;to Asia, Latin America, the Middle East&mdash;and this of course had consequences on the time spent in each region.</p>
<p>Managing risk also has become much more complex for banks. It&rsquo;s not only market risk; there is more and more political and social risk. Increasingly, financial markets are becoming political markets. That requires different skills&mdash;skills not all of us have acquired at university; how to properly deal with society, for example, a stakeholder that has immensely grown in importance since the financial crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Ghosn:</strong> I don&rsquo;t think leadership shows unless it is highlighted by some kind of crisis. There are two kinds. There are internal crises that arise because a company has not been managed well. Then there are external crises, like the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the earthquake in Japan or the flood in Thailand. In that case, you are managing your company, and all of a sudden there is this thing falling on you.</p>
<p>Business schools may prepare people to deal with internal crises. But I think we need to be more prepared for external crises, where it&rsquo;s not the strategy of the company that is in question; it&rsquo;s the ability of leaders to figure out how to <em>adapt</em> that strategy.</p>
<p>We are going to have a lot more of these external crises because we are living in such a volatile world&mdash;an age where everything is leveraged and technology moves so fast. You can be rocked by something that originated completely outside your area.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons Nissan has been able to cope with external crises better than some of our competitors is that we have a more diverse, multinational culture. We don&rsquo;t just sit around waiting for the solution to come from headquarters. We are accustomed to always looking around, trying to find out who has the best ideas. Our people in the US talk to our people in Japan on an equal level. We have a lot more reference points.</p>
<p><strong>Ellen Kullman:</strong> These days, there are things that just come shooting across the bow&mdash;economic volatility and the impact of natural events like the Japanese earthquake and tsunami&mdash;at much greater frequency than we&rsquo;ve ever seen. You have to be able to react very quickly. And the world is so connected that the feedback loops are more intense. You&rsquo;ve got population growth and the world passing seven billion people last year, and the stresses that causes, whether it&rsquo;s feeding the world, creating enough energy, or protecting the environment. We matched our focus, our research and development, and our capital expenditures up against megatrends like these over the last five years. This is the future, so we need to understand how our science relates to it.</p>
<p><strong>Shimon Peres:</strong> The last two decades have witnessed the greatest revolution since Genesis. States have lost their importance and strength. The old theories&mdash;from Adam Smith to Karl Marx&mdash;have lost their value because they are based on things like land, labor, and wealth. All of that has been replaced by science. Ideas are now more important than materials. And ideas are unpredictable. Science knows no customs, no borders. It doesn&rsquo;t depend on distances or stop at a given point.</p>
<p>Science creates a world where individuals can play the role of the collective. Two boys create Google. One boy creates Facebook. Another individual creates Apple. These gentlemen changed the world without political parties or armies or fortunes. No one anticipated this. And they themselves did not know what would happen as a result of their thoughts. So we are all surprised. It is a new world. You may have the strongest army&mdash;but it cannot conquer ideas, it cannot conquer knowledge.</p>
<br />
<h3>Mastering today&rsquo;s personal challenges</h3>
<p><em>The rigors of leadership have prompted many leaders to think of themselves as being in training, much like a professional athlete: continually striving to manage their energy and fortify their character. There is a growing recognition of the connection between physical health, emotional health, and judgment&mdash;and of how important it can be to have precise routines for diet, sleep, exercise, and staying centered.</em><a href="#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text">For more on centered leadership, see Joanna Barsh, Josephine Mogelof, and Caroline Webb, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_page.aspx?ar=2678">How centered leaders achieve extraordinary results</a>,&rdquo; <em>McKinsey Quarterly</em>, 2010 Number 4.</span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Moya Greene:</strong> The first criterion is: do you love it? It&rsquo;s a seven-day-a-week job. I think that&rsquo;s true for anyone in these roles. If you don&rsquo;t love the company and the people&mdash;<em>really</em> love them&mdash; you can&rsquo;t do a job like this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty energetic. I start at five in the morning. I don&rsquo;t even think about it anymore; the alarm goes off and I&rsquo;m up. I go for a 30-minute run. I do weight training three mornings a week. I try to eat well, but not too much. I&rsquo;m a big walker&mdash;that&rsquo;s my favorite thing. I try to get a good walk every weekend. I go on walking vacations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve usually got three or four books on the go. I&rsquo;ve given up on novels. I can&rsquo;t get through them no matter how good they are; there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll finish before there&rsquo;s some kind of interruption. So I read poetry now: the collected works of Ted Hughes, Emily Dickinson. I&rsquo;m working my way through Philip Larkin. You can take a Larkin poem and read it on the bus in 15 minutes. The good ones stay with you and will come back to you. That&rsquo;s what I like about poetry: you get a little shot of mental protein without a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>Josef Ackermann:</strong> Just to give you an idea of my calendar for the next ten days: Berlin tomorrow, then Seoul, then Munich, then Frankfurt, then Singapore, then the Middle East. I&rsquo;m almost constantly on a plane. With all this traveling, physical stamina has become much more important.</p>
<p>I remember a time when after flying to Hong Kong you could take a whole day off to recover. Today, right after landing you rush to your first meeting. And maybe you already have a conference call in the car on your way into town. You are lucky if you get enough time to take a shower.</p>
<p>And of course, with all the new information technology, you are constantly available, and the flow of information you have to manage is huge; that has added to the pressure. You are much more exposed to unforeseen shifts and negative surprises and you have to make quick decisions and respond to or anticipate market movements around the world. So you have to have a very stable psyche as well. I see more and more people these days who just burn out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a tech freak. I use my iPhone and send text messages, that&rsquo;s it. I still like to have paper in front of me and I do a lot in written-memo form. I think people who constantly use their BlackBerry or iPhone easily lose sight of the big picture.</p>
<p>It also helps me enormously that I can sleep anywhere, whether I am in a car or an airplane. If you&rsquo;re unable to relax quickly, I think you can&rsquo;t be a CEO for a considerable length of time. Some people do meditation or yoga. I don&rsquo;t do any such thing. I think you have it in your DNA or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Vasella:</strong> I talk to my team about the seductions that come with taking on a leadership role. There are many different forms: sexual seduction, money, praise. You need to be aware of how you can be seduced in order to be able to resist and keep your integrity.</p>
<p>Every CEO needs someone who can listen&mdash;a board member, an adviser&mdash;someone to whom he can speak in total confidence, to whom he can say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it; I&rsquo;m about to resign.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I really want to beat this guy up.&rdquo; You need someone who understands and can help you to find the balance. Leaders often forget the importance of stable emotional relationships&mdash;especially outside the company. It helps tremendously to manage stress. Your partner will do a lot to help keep you in sync.</p>
<p>You have to be able to switch on and switch off. Are you entirely present when you&rsquo;re present? Can you be entirely away when you&rsquo;re away? The expectation is that your job is 24/7. But no one can be the boss 24/7. You need to have a moment when you say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m home now,&rdquo; and work is gone.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Ghosn:</strong> Leading takes a lot of stamina. I became CEO at 45. But I was working like a beast. You think, &ldquo;So I work 15, 16 hours a day; who cares?&rdquo; But you can&rsquo;t do that when you are 60 or 65.</p>
<p>And now companies are more global. So you have jet lag, you are tired, the food is different. You have to be very disciplined about schedules and about organizing everything. Physical discipline is crucial, for food, exercise, sleep. I live like a monk&mdash;well, maybe not a monk, but a Knight Templar. I wake at a certain hour, sleep at a certain hour. There are certain things I won&rsquo;t do past a certain time.</p>
<p><strong>Ellen Kullman:</strong> I spend a lot more time on communication, more time out at plant sites, in sales offices, with customers, in our research laboratories. I&rsquo;m bringing my board of directors to India in a couple of weeks to help them really see the issues we&rsquo;re facing. That&rsquo;s where I get my energy from. It&rsquo;s contagious. I come away from these engagements with ideas, energy, and a real sense of focus on where we as a company need to go. That&rsquo;s part of what drives me.</p>
<p><strong>Shimon Peres:</strong> The mind of a leader must be free&mdash;a mind that can dream and imagine. All new things were born in dreams. A leader must have the courage to be a nonconformist, just like a scientist. He must dream, even if he dreams alone or if people laugh at him. He must not let his heart falter.</p>
<p>Today, the separation between generations is stronger than between nations. Our children say, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t impose upon us your own arrogance&mdash;the world you created, wounded by war, corrupted by money, separated by hatred. And don&rsquo;t try to build artificial walls between us and other youngsters.&rdquo; Because they were born in a new age. For them, the modern equipment of communication is what paper and pen are for us. They can communicate much more easily and don&rsquo;t feel all this hidden discrimination that we were born with and find so difficult to get rid of.</p>
<h3>The (now 24/7) public face of leadership</h3>
<p><em>Nearly everyone we spoke with commented on the challenge of dealing with constant scrutiny and of acting as a connector in a complex ecosystem. As the face of the organization, leaders must be prepared to address the immediate, practical concerns of the job while also maintaining and articulating a long-term vision of the organization&rsquo;s purpose and role in society&mdash;all against a backdrop of 24-hour financial coverage, ubiquitous blogs, and Twitter feeds. That means learning new modes of communicating across today&rsquo;s far-flung networks and working harder to craft clear, simple messages that resonate across cultures.</em></p>
<p><strong>Josef Ackermann:</strong> CEOs have become highly public figures. And media scrutiny has become very personal. Particularly in our home market, Germany, it&rsquo;s always, &ldquo;Ackermann says this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ackermann&rsquo;s doing that&rdquo;&mdash;even if I personally had nothing to do with it. You are the institution you lead.</p>
<p>After I became CEO, the former head of the Bundesbank one day took me aside and gave me some valuable advice: &ldquo;From now on, you must remember that you are two people. You are the person whom you and your friends know, but you are also a symbol for something. Never confuse the two. Don&rsquo;t take criticism of the symbol as criticism of the person.&rdquo; That advice has helped me a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Vasella:</strong> People have a legitimate demand for access to the CEO. But you have to modulate that so you avoid overexposure. You&rsquo;re a product. And the press will paint you as either a hero or a villain&mdash;whatever sells. If they paint you as a hero today, you should be prepared to be painted as a villain tomorrow. Not everything you do will work out every time, and you have to accept that people will be unfair.</p>
<p><strong>Moya Greene:</strong> A decade ago, I&rsquo;d have said that it was harder to be a public official than an executive in the private sector. But the tables have turned. It&rsquo;s tough these days to be the CEO of any business&mdash;even a very successful one with a balanced view of the corporation&rsquo;s position in society.</p>
<p>My public-sector experience has helped me to understand how easily sound policies can be derailed by small, symbolic things. It may not matter that the policy change you are advocating is the product of fantastic analytics or years of brilliant stakeholder management; the tiniest little spark can become a flash fire&mdash;something that takes hold and transforms perceptions in ways that don&rsquo;t seem rational. If you work in the public sector, you learn the value of developing antennae for popular perceptions and keeping them finely tuned.</p>
<p>I spend about 15 percent of my time trying to help our own people understand how good we are at what we do, which isn&rsquo;t always easy, because there is so much negativism in the press. I see good internal communications as a way to punch through and get our message out, to tell our people&mdash;who are the most powerful ambassadors for our brand&mdash;&ldquo;Stand up and be proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Ghosn:</strong> In business, there are no more heroes. The media has become a lot more negative about corporate leaders over the past ten years. Small mistakes get blown up into huge things.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine myself today doing what I did in Japan in 1999, when I stood up and said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get rid of the seniority system. We&rsquo;re going to shut down plants. We&rsquo;re going to reduce headcount. We&rsquo;re going to undo the keiretsu system.&rdquo; I had a lot of criticism. But there were also people who said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give him the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo; Today, if I were to stand up and try to do something like that, I would get massacred. I would need much more emotional stability and certainty. Leaders of tomorrow are going to have to be incredibly secure and sure of themselves.</p>
<p>Leaders of the future will also need to have a lot more empathy and sensitivity&mdash;not just for people from their own countries but for people from completely different countries and cultures. They are going to need global empathy, which is a lot more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Shimon Peres:</strong> Words are the connection between leaders and the public. They must be credible and clear and reflect a vision, not just a position. The three greatest leaders of the 20th century were Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, and David Ben-Gurion. Each had a brilliant mind and a brilliant pen. Their ability with a pen demonstrated many things: curiosity, memory, courage. They understood that you lead not with bayonets but with words. A leader&rsquo;s words must be precise and totally committed.</p>
<br />
<h3>Decision making under uncertainty</h3>
<p><em>A final theme is that leaders must increasingly resist the temptation to cope with chaos and complexity by trusting their gut. At a time of extreme volatility, past experience is an unreliable guide to future outcomes. Leaders must create cultures of constructive skepticism and surround themselves with people who bring multiple perspectives and have no fear of challenging the boss.</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos Ghosn:</strong> It is a paradox: on the one hand, you have to be more confident and secure, but on the other, you have to be a lot more open and empathetic. You need to listen, but then when you make a decision, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;you must be a very hard driver. Usually, these are not attributes you find in the same person.</p>
<p>Once you have done the analysis and made the decision, then you have to learn to simplify the decision in communicating it to others. Everything&rsquo;s complex, but once you have decided, sometimes you need to simplify so much it&rsquo;s almost a caricature. You must say, &ldquo;Nothing matters beyond this.&rdquo; You must reduce everything to zeros or ones, black or white, go or no-go. You can&rsquo;t have too much nuance.</p>
<p>In a crisis, you have to be able to do all of these things&mdash;listening, deciding, and then simplifying&mdash;very quickly. That is what makes leading in a crisis so interesting. And because you have to move so fast, you have to empower people to make decisions themselves. That&rsquo;s the best way to restore calm.</p>
<p><strong>Moya Greene:</strong> When I came here, we were running out of cash. I was grappling with decisions that would determine whether or not we could stay in business. But you cannot position your company in the broader social and economic fabric of the nation if all you do is look at the financial dimensions of performance. You have to look at what your customers think, what your employees think, and what you can do for your customers.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Vasella:</strong> As a leader, to whom can you express your doubts&mdash;and should you? In which situation is it appropriate and when not? I believe that you have to be able to express doubt in your team and with a board. If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;and you pretend&mdash;then you are playing a role, which eventually leads to an unhealthy situation. That&rsquo;s not to say you should act like you&rsquo;re in a confessional. At some point [in decision making], you have to take the sword and cut through the Gordian knot and make a decision, despite any uncertainties.</p>
<p>But the question is: are you being led by the context or do you lead? Are you being led by your followers and are they choosing for you? Or do you choose and do you lead? I think you have to be aware of the context, and what people expect and hope for. But as a leader, you&rsquo;re not there to feed people with all the things they hope for. Your job is to persuade people to do the things you believe will be the right direction for the long term. People want you to lead. And if you lead, you will hurt. You will satisfy sometimes. You will celebrate and you will blame. That&rsquo;s all part of your job.</p>
<p><strong>Josef Ackermann:</strong> Problems have become so complex today that you have to collect the expertise and opinions of a lot of people before you can make a sound decision. Some people say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t decide until you have to.&rdquo; I have a completely different view. I hate to be under time pressure. I think it is important that you aren&rsquo;t confronted with a situation where you haven&rsquo;t heard anything on a particular issue for half a year&mdash;and then suddenly you have to make a quick decision on the basis of an executive summary.</p>
<p>I believe in personal leadership, but no CEO can do it all on his own. You need the expertise, judgment, and buy-in of your team.</p>
<br />

<h3>Preparing for a new era of leadership</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s never been realistic to break leadership into a fixed set of essential competences, and that&rsquo;s particularly the case in today&rsquo;s complex, volatile environment. Still, the themes our interviewees sounded represent a rich set of opportunities for leaders to boost their effectiveness. To close, we&rsquo;d like to amplify and extend those themes by emphasizing three skills that can help leaders thrive in today&rsquo;s turbulent environment, which for many has prompted a reexamination of fundamental assumptions about how they do their jobs, while underscoring the importance of leading with a purpose. Resilient leaders, as Shimon Peres reminded us, are those who have &ldquo;ambition for a cause greater than themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>1. See with a microscope and a telescope</h3>
<p>Over the next two decades, McKinsey research suggests, the conditions of the late 20th century&mdash;cheap capital, low interest rates, a global demographic dividend, and a gradual decline in commodity prices&mdash;will either be reversed or seesaw violently. Managing the immediacy of these changes, while also staying alert for the inflection points that signal bigger, long-term &ldquo;trend breaks,&rdquo; will require leaders to see the world in multiple ways at once.</p>
<p>In different ways, many leaders have told us they&rsquo;ve needed to develop a facility for viewing the world through two lenses: a telescope, to consider opportunities far into the future, and a microscope, to scrutinize challenges of the moment at intense magnification. Most of us are naturally more comfortable with one lens or the other; we are &ldquo;farsighted&rdquo; or &ldquo;nearsighted,&rdquo; but rarely both. In times of complexity, leaders must be able to see clearly through either lens and to manage the shift between the two with speed and ease.</p>
<p>Leaders must use the telescope to watch for long-term trends, dream big dreams, imagine where a company should be in five or ten years, and reallocate resources accordingly. The accelerating pace of technological innovation makes this aspect of a leader&rsquo;s role more important than ever. The microscope, too, affords a critical perspective. Leaders must force their organizations to challenge conventional wisdom; consider the implications of unlikely, &ldquo;long-tail&rdquo; scenarios; and focus on pressing issues in minute detail. As organizations grow larger and more complex, leaders must work harder to stay in touch with the front line and view themselves as &ldquo;chief reality testers.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>2. Compete as a tri-sector athlete</h3>
<p>Many of the forces buffeting leaders in the private sector&mdash;slow growth, unemployment, sovereign indebtedness&mdash;can be addressed only in concert with the public sector and are heavily influenced by the actions of groups that are neither commercial nor governmental entities. When governments play an ever more active role in regulating markets, and social movements can spring up in a matter of days, corporate leaders must be nimble &ldquo;tri-sector athletes,&rdquo; to borrow a phrase from Harvard political scientist Joseph Nye: able to engage and collaborate across the private, public, and social sectors. Leaders of governments and nongovernmental organizations must likewise break out of their silos. Issues such as infrastructure, unemployment, education, or protecting the environment are too complex and interrelated to deal with in isolation. Many of the leaders with whom we spoke said they have learned the value of examining their business decisions in a social and political context. Even those wary of open-ended discussions about corporate social responsibility say they find it useful to think about managing a &ldquo;triple bottom line&rdquo; that reflects their organizations&rsquo; performance in the public, private, and social spheres.</p>
<h3>3. Stay grounded during a crisis </h3>
<p>Everyone we interviewed agreed that modern leaders spend far more of their time firefighting than their predecessors did. Coping with externally generated crises, many argued, has become a key part of the modern leader&rsquo;s role. In an age when crisis is the new normal, global organizations need leaders who are able to act quickly and calmly amid chaos. Many leaders highlighted the value of &ldquo;stress-testing&rdquo; members of the top team to gauge their ability to cope with crisis. We heard again and again that otherwise competent managers can&rsquo;t always perform in moments of extraordinary pressure. The chief executive of one of the world&rsquo;s largest companies marveled at how, in the face of a cash flow crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, two of his top reports &ldquo;shattered like glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emotional and physical stamina demanded of leaders today is extraordinary. Many of those we interviewed reserve crucial decisions for moments when they know they will be rested and free from distraction. They also talked about sequencing decisions to focus on key issues first, not after they have been depleted by lesser matters. We are intrigued by the growing body of research in psychology, sociology, and neuroscience that highlights the importance of &ldquo;decision fatigue.&rdquo; The implication of this research is that trying to make too many decisions at once diminishes the ability to make wise decisions at all.</p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>If the burden of leadership in the modern age seems overwhelming, the potential benefits are overwhelming too. Large organizations&mdash; if led well&mdash;can do more for more people than they have at any other moment in history. That is the flip side of all the chaos, complexity, and pressure, and it makes leading through those challenges a noble endeavor.</p>

      <title>Another oil shock?</title>
      <description>It’s possible, though far from certain, that oil prices will spike in the years ahead. Here’s why—and how you can prepare.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/energy_resources_materials/another_oil_shock/~/media/McKinsey/dotcom/Insights/Energy Resources Materials/Another oil shock/anoi11_frth_Thumbnail.ashx"/><p><strong>It&rsquo;s been a while</strong> since the world has been truly preoccupied with the threat of sustained high oil prices. The global economic recovery has been muted, and a double-dip recession remains possible.</p>
<p>But that dour prospect shouldn&rsquo;t make executives sanguine about the risk of another oil shock. Emerging markets are still in the midst of a historic transition toward greater energy consumption. When global economic performance becomes more robust, oil demand is likely to grow faster than supply capacity can. As that happens, at some point before too long supply and demand could collide&mdash;gently or ferociously.</p>
<p>The case for the benign scenario rests on a steady evolution away from oil consumption in areas such as transportation, chemical production, power, and home heating. Moves by many major economies to impose tougher automotive fuel efficiency standards are a step in this direction. However, fully achieving the needed transition will take more stringent regulation, such as the abolition of fuel subsidies in oil-producing countries, Asia, and elsewhere, as well as widespread consumer behavior changes. And historically, governments, companies, and consumers have been disinclined to tackle tough policy choices or make big changes until their backs are against the wall. </p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p>This inertia suggests another scenario&mdash;one that&rsquo;s sufficiently plausible and underappreciated that we think it&rsquo;s worth exploring: the prospect that within this decade, the world could experience a period of significant volatility, with oil prices leaping upward and oscillating between $125 and $175 a barrel (or higher) for some time. The resulting economic pain would be significant. Economic modeling by our colleagues suggests that by 2020, global GDP would be about $1.5 trillion smaller than expected, if oil prices spiked and stayed high for several years. </p>
<p>But like any difficult transition, this one also would create major opportunities&mdash;for consumers of energy to differentiate their cost structures from competitors that aren&rsquo;t prepared and for a host of energy innovators to create substitutes for oil and tap into new sources of supply. Furthermore, if we endured a period of high and volatile prices that lasted for two or three years, by 2020 or so oil could face real competition from other energy sources. </p>

    <summary><strong>The automotive sector’s road to greater fuel efficiency</strong></summary>
    <figure>
      <table  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" border="1">
        <tr><td><p><b>Russel Hensley and Andreas Zielke</b></p><p><strong>Regulatory standards already in place</strong> should dramatically enhance the efficiency of autos around the world. The European Union’s carbon emissions rules, for example, require annual improvements of 6 percent a year between 2015 and 2020. This implies, according to our analysis, that new cars driving on European roads will consume 40 to 50 percent less fuel in 2020 than they did in 2010. Regulators in China, Japan, and the United States are also eyeing ambitious rates of improvement, albeit from different starting points. US fuel economy levels in 2020—at around 40 miles a gallon—would lag behind China’s in that year and simply match Europe’s 2010 levels. </p><p>
The automotive industry, boxed in by fierce global competition and flat prices, has responded in the past by pushing design improvements and productivity gains that make room for costly new content, including technology required for meeting regulatory standards. Here’s one example: if you adjust for inflation the cost of a 2001 Toyota Camry, you see that by 2010, the price of the car to US consumers had actually dropped by $2,500 in real terms—although the 2010 Camry was better equipped and 10 percent more fuel efficient. As automakers work hard to meet new and tougher fuel economy standards, they are likely to follow the same playbook. The starting point: improving internal-combustion engines, which still offer significant opportunities to enhance efficiency and emissions performance. On the other hand, high battery costs would be likely to require automakers to raise prices, making a sweeping shift to electric vehicles more difficult between now and, say, 2020. </p><p>
A sustained oil price spike could well prompt regulators in mature economies to up the ante—for example, by increasing support for electric vehicles—and speed a broader adoption of tougher standards in developing economies, which will represent most of the new demand for transportation fuel going forward. This would create additional momentum for change.</p><p>
Still, for a major shift in the global automotive stock to occur within the decade, consumer behavior or technology would need to change in dramatic and currently unforeseen ways. One possibility would be for a higher proportion of car buyers to begin prioritizing fuel economy. While the importance of this factor varies around the world, our consumer research suggests that in two major car markets, Germany and the United States, car buyers rank this attribute outside the top ten they consider when buying a new car.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote4' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote4' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
We conducted online interviews with 2,200 new-vehicle buyers in Germany and the United States. The sample included purchasers of cars, trucks, flex-fuel vehicles, and diesel vehicles, weighted to match the demographic characteristics and brand and power train preferences of each national market. Consumer rankings of attributes, derived through conjoint analysis, represented the implied importance attached to them by buyers. Implied importance often differs from stated importance but can be more accurate because it is less likely to reflect respondents’ beliefs about the answers they are “expected” to provide.

Comparing Europe and the United States highlights the magnitude of the challenge: although gasoline prices are twice as high in the former, the share of autos running on oil-based derivatives (gasoline and diesel) and alternative fuels is roughly the same in both. For the economics to become more appealing, advanced technology, especially electric-vehicle batteries, would need to come down the cost curve faster than expected while oil and gasoline prices crossed some new threshold of pain.</p><div class="about-authors"><h3 class="sm black">About the authors</h3><p><b>Russell Hensley</b> is a principal in McKinsey’s Detroit office, and <b>Andreas Zielke</b> is a director in the Berlin office.</p></div></td></tr>

<p>To paint a clearer picture for senior executives of what such a world would mean for them&mdash;and how to prepare now&mdash;we asked several colleagues to join us in a thought experiment about the impact of a prolonged oil price spike. Russell Hensley and Andreas Zielke, from McKinsey&rsquo;s automotive practice, explain how intensified regulation already is leading a transition toward greater fuel economy, as well as the potential for higher oil prices to reinforce that momentum (see sidebar &ldquo;The automotive sector&rsquo;s road to greater fuel efficiency&rdquo;). Jonathan Ablett, Lowell Bryan, and Sven Smit, from McKinsey&rsquo;s strategy practice, assess the global economic impact of an oil price spike and the strategic implications of a slower-growth environment (see sidebar &ldquo;Anticipating economic headwinds&rdquo;). Finally, Knut Alicke and Tobias Meyer, from McKinsey&rsquo;s operations practice, describe energy-efficient supply chain strategies that some companies are already undertaking (see sidebar &ldquo;Building a supply chain that can withstand high oil prices&rdquo;). </p>

Indeed, we estimate that this type of shock would drive down global growth by 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points in the first year.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote5' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote5' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
All GDP and growth estimates in this article are the result of economic analysis we and our colleagues in McKinsey’s strategy practice conducted using the firm’s global-growth model, a tool for long-term scenario planning. The model links energy and capital markets to output and highlights relationships between growth and structural factors such as urbanization, education, and industry structure shifts. It can generate globally consistent scenarios for 20 countries, nine regions, and the world as a whole.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> Over time, as economies adjusted to the new higher prices (and shifted to different types of fuel, technologies, and production techniques) the impact would diminish. But the rate of global GDP growth would be affected for years. By 2020, the global economy would be between $1.1 trillion and $1.7 trillion smaller than the baseline outlook: the equivalent of losing Spain’s or Italy’s output for a year.</p><p>
A sustained growth drag of that magnitude would be serious, particularly for Europe and the United States, which are already suffering from sluggish recoveries and lingering unemployment. It could contribute to a double-dip recession in those markets and to trouble in the global economy as a whole, which also is fragile and faces other potential shocks, including sovereign-debt defaults, inflation in emerging markets, and problems in the Chinese financial sector.</p><p>
Senior executives can reduce the odds of getting whipsawed by the impact of an oil price spike if they push their planning teams to evaluate, at a fairly granular level, the likely growth impact of surging energy prices. Where are customers most vulnerable to energy cost increases, and where would they be less significant? In fact, our modeling suggests that the country-level impact of spiking oil prices would be quite uneven—and not just because of differences in the energy efficiency of various economies. Even more important, our analysis indicates, are variations in the relative size of the industrial sector in different countries. That means export-oriented advanced manufacturing economies, such as Germany and Japan, are more vulnerable than their relative energy efficiency might indicate (exhibit).</p>

In addition, business leaders should be preparing for a world in which energy-related growth slowdowns could occur in an oscillating and unpredictable manner. For example, oil prices might fly up to a point (far in excess of $125 a barrel) where global GDP growth completely stalled and new sources of energy supply rapidly became economic. That, in turn, might drive prices down somewhat, leading to a resumption of economic growth and a repetition of the cycle. In a world like that, management approaches that some companies experimented with during the financial crisis—such as shorter financial-planning cycles or even moving away from calendar-based approaches to budgeting and planning—may be important.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote6' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>2</sup></a> <span id='footnote6' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>2.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

When you combine the likelihood of oil price volatility with related uncertainties—such as the potential for swings in the dollar versus other currencies and commodities as global economic activity rebalances from the developed world toward emerging markets—you may want to abandon any presumption that you can predict medium-term oil prices.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote7' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>3</sup></a> <span id='footnote7' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>3.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> Indeed, it may be more fruitful to stress-test your financial plans and strategies for different oil (and currency) prices, see what happens to the plans at the extremes, and then prepare for contingencies.

<h3>A delicate balance</h3>
<p>The world is very far from running out of oil. By most estimates, at least a trillion barrels of conventional oil still reside beneath the earth&rsquo;s surface, not to mention several trillion more barrels of oil or gas that could be extracted through unconventional sources, such as oil sands.</p>

<p><b>Knut Alicke and Tobias Meyer</b></p>
<p><strong>We don&rsquo;t need to look very hard</strong> for a live case study of what happens to global supply chains when oil prices spike. Just three years ago, when they shot up to $125 and beyond, it became painfully obvious to many companies that their supply chains were not viable at those levels.</p>
<p>Research we conducted at that time indicated that even if oil prices were as low as $40 a barrel, it would still make economic sense for companies to take a variety of actions that collectively would reduce the energy intensity of global supply chains by almost one-fourth. Energy intensity could be reduced by more than one-third if oil prices stayed above $100 a barrel for a prolonged period (exhibit). The potential would be even greater at higher prices. </p>

<p>Here are some of the opportunities that farsighted companies are beginning to act on:</p>
<p><b>Utilizing space-saving packages.</b> A retailer and a wholesaler partnered to create a new, stackable format for milk containers. As a result, they no longer need traditional shipping crates for truck transport, thus freeing up additional space for other cargo and avoiding the need to haul back the empty crates.</p>
<p><b>Operating larger ships and trucks.</b> Vale, the Brazil-based miner, took delivery this year of its first new ultralarge ore carrier, with 400,000 deadweight tons of capacity&mdash;more than twice that of today&rsquo;s standard vessel on the most important trade routes&mdash;to ship iron ore from Brazil to China. Scale is important because doubling the capacity of a transport asset typically increases its energy efficiency by one-fourth. The same goes for trucks too. In emerging markets, where average truck size is less than half that in OECD<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote9"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote9" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>countries, partly because of poorer infrastructure and smaller retail outlets, every percentage point of average truck size would reduce fuel consumption per unit of capacity by about 0.4 to 0.6 points. </p>
<p><b>Combining new technologies.</b> Maersk, the Danish container liner, used most of the available technological advances when it placed orders for its new 400-meter-long vessels, each with space for 18,000 20-foot container units. These vessels set a new benchmark in maritime energy efficiency by virtue of their size, slower speed, design improvements, and a waste heat&ndash;recovery system that reduces the engine&rsquo;s fuel consumption.</p>
<p><b>Switching to alternative fuels.</b> A road transport company recently estimated that it would save &euro;15,000 a year per truck by converting its small fleet to run on vegetable oil rather than traditional diesel fuel. Because of North America&rsquo;s recent flood of supply of natural gas, companies could also convert fleets to run on liquified natural gas (LNG) instead of diesel. </p>
<p><b>Practicing smarter driving.</b> Examining data collected by onboard computers, a logistics company found significant differences in the driving patterns and fuel consumption of drivers. Shifting to best practice could shave 10 percent off its $4 million annual fuel bill, with onboard computers helping employees drive more economically. </p>
<p>Regulators also have a role to play. In the United States, the fuel efficiency gain of lowering the cap on truck speeds on highways could be 7 to 10 percent. Truck speeds are already capped to lower levels in Europe. But there are still opportunities&mdash;for instance, allowing longer (and potentially heavier) truck/trailer combinations in Europe&rsquo;s road transport market could reduce its use of diesel by around 15 percent. </p>
<p>These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Further existing technological opportunities&mdash;such as trucks with better aerodynamics and ocean vessels with new, friction-reducing hull coatings&mdash;are economical at the $100-a-barrel prices that have prevailed recently. High prices also should induce companies to cut the distance products travel. Moving final assembly into regions of demand would make it sensible to manufacture less valuable components there, such as primary packaging, manuals, or power cables for electric goods. An alternative is to ship products with low value density by slow and more energy efficient modes of transport. </p>
<p>Optimizing the energy efficiency of a supply chain&rsquo;s production process, location footprint, transportation, and inventory is a complex task made harder by inevitable tensions between the supply chain group and functions such as sales, service, and product development. There are thorny trade-offs&mdash;for example, between service levels and the lower speed of energy-efficient transport. </p>
<p>Part of the answer will be creating nimbler supply chains&mdash;for example, by using slower, more energy-efficient modes (such as ocean freight) for the base load and reserving the faster, less energy-efficient modes (such as air freight) for peak demand. CEOs also will need to facilitate meaningful discussion of important cross-functional supply chain issues so that executives can collaborate to uphold a company&rsquo;s best interests.</p>

<p>More relevant for prices, though, is how much spare oil production capacity exists in the world. Three million or four million barrels a day typically represents a comfortable buffer when the global economy is healthy. If that buffer shrinks, and markets expect strong demand growth to continue, prices can rise&mdash;sometimes dramatically. That&rsquo;s what happened prior to the 2008&ndash;09 financial crisis as surging emerging-market demand strained production capacity and prices approached $150 a barrel. This fly-up was short lived because the ensuing deep recession wiped out between three million and four million barrels a day of demand, sending oil prices sharply down. </p>
<p>During the sluggish recovery that followed, the global supply cushion shrank again, punctuated in the first half of 2011 by Libya&rsquo;s civil war, which disrupted supplies from that country and knocked off a million barrels a day of global capacity. That tightness set the stage for price fly-ups to $120 a barrel in the first half of this year and underscores the strength of the pre-2008 fundamentals. </p>
<p>Going forward, barring prolonged economic stagnation, demand growth for liquids<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> For the sake of simplicity, in most of this article we use the term &ldquo;oil&rdquo; as short-hand for &ldquo;liquids,&rdquo; which comprise all liquid fuels derived from crude oil, as well as liquid fuels from natural-gas liquids (NGLs), biofuels, gas to liquids (GTLs), and coal to liquids (CTLs). </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>is likely to chug ahead at around 1.5 percent a year. The pace would be even faster without the steady improvements in energy efficiency that we and other energy analysts foresee, particularly for cars and trucks as a result of technology improvements and stiffening regulatory standards that are already on the books.</p>
<p>Could supply growth accelerate to keep pace? Many industry analysts and our own supply model suggest that it won&rsquo;t be easy. Despite high oil prices for much of the past decade and surging investment outlays by many major private and national oil companies alike, capacity has risen by only slightly more than 1 percent a year during that time. The logistics, supply systems, and political alignment needed to extract new oil supplies make that a complex, expensive, and time-consuming business. And coaxing more output out of existing oil fields, which typically have high production-decline rates, also is costly and challenging. </p>
<p>Our current projections suggest that in a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; scenario,<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote2" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">2.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Our business-as-usual scenario assumes that between 2010 and 2020, the world economy will grow at the rate currently anticipated by many analysts (3.0 to 3.5 percent) and that oil prices won&rsquo;t significantly exceed $100 a barrel during this period. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>the world could reach a realistic supply capacity of around 100 million barrels a day by 2020, up from 91 million or 92 million today. That, however, would barely suffice to meet the roughly 100 million barrels of liquids the world would consume each day in such a scenario, up from 88 million or 89 million today. </p>
<h3>When supply and demand collide</h3>
<p>Simple math suggests that at some point, something has to give. And when it does, the world will have to start taking steps away from today&rsquo;s oil dependence. The question is how rapid and volatile that transition will be.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">The case for a gentle collision</h3>
<p>This critical shift could happen in an orderly fashion, without price spikes, if governments, companies, and consumers worked together to accelerate the adoption of measures that reduce demand. Indeed, a common denominator of current forecasts by industry analysts (including ourselves) is a gradual transition in most regions toward lower oil intensity in transportation, power, and residential heating. But according to our analysis, it would take more than current trends in oil conservation (spurred by existing legislation) for supply to meet demand if robust economic growth returned. </p>
<p>A few examples illustrate the scale and scope of the task facing the world if we are to realize a gentle transition. Governments would need to raise auto fuel efficiency standards further, and consumers would need to place greater emphasis on fuel economy when they bought new cars. Policy makers in several developing countries would need to abolish fuel subsidies so that consumers felt the real price of oil. Around the world, we&rsquo;d need to see deeper reductions in the use of oil for heating, power generation, and chemical manufacturing. Some transport by ships and heavy trucks would need to start shifting toward more reliance on natural gas as a fuel.</p>
<p>Changes like these could push oil supply and demand roughly into balance. However, they would require new policies and significant changes in how consumers and businesses behave. What&rsquo;s more, they would need to start now because it will take years before the changes required to constrain oil consumption begin to take effect. If we do not succeed in implementing these changes in a farsighted way, the system faces a risk of falling out of balance. </p>
<h3 class="sm black">Why the adjustment could be violent</h3>
<p>That brings us to a second scenario: it&rsquo;s possible to imagine global supply and demand for oil colliding faster, and more ferociously, resulting in a price spike as the global capacity buffer melted away. As we&rsquo;ve said, anticipated economic growth alone could cause demand to expand faster than supply. Another possible trigger: supply disruption, which does happen from time to time. The possibilities include an exceptionally severe hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, violence in the Niger Delta, instability in Venezuela, and further tension in the Middle East.</p>
<p>If this new price spike took place, it could have a more significant impact on global consumption patterns than most executives expect (for audio commentary by Occo Roelofsen, see the interactive, &ldquo;How might a sustained oil price spike affect demand?&rdquo;). For starters, it would hit global growth, which in turn would immediately knock down oil demand. In addition, there would be some rapid behavioral effects, such as a reduction in car, air, and sea travel. If the spike lasted longer, it could cause several more structural shifts, such as prompting individuals to use different modes of transport or even to look for work closer to home, encouraging companies to reverse offshoring trends and bring supply chains closer to home, accelerating the substitution of videoconferences for air travel, and pushing the freight transport industry to adopt less oil-intensive modes. </p>

    </div></div>
<p>Because such shifts would take time, a high-price environment could last for years, not months, accelerating several other ongoing trends that, when combined, could lead to even further demand reductions. In other words, a sustained price spike could scare consumers, companies, and governments into more drastic responses&mdash;accelerating the transition to a less oil-dependent economy. A price spike of one to three years could be long enough to make governments raise standards for fuel efficiency at an accelerated pace and prompt automakers, reacting to regulatory changes, to modify their product-development road maps. Ultimately, all this would lead to more rapid efficiency gains and potentially to faster electric-vehicle penetration. </p>
<p>A prolonged price spike also could prompt investments in infrastructure needed to support the use of electric vehicles or other alternatives (such as natural gas and hydrogen) to traditional fuel sources. Such investments could have an impact on oil demand for trucking, light vehicles, and shipping. What&rsquo;s more, very high oil prices would intensify energy efficiency efforts up and down the supply chain and reduce the amount of plastics used in packaging, thus shrinking demand for oil in chemicals. Additional government action, in the form of either more stringent regulation on the use of plastics or subsidized financing that reduced the up-front cost to consumers of switching away from fuel oil in residential heating, could play an important role in this transition. </p>
<p>All along the way, of course, these reactions, plus slower global growth, would do their part to exert some downward pressure on oil prices. Expanded supply would also play a role. From now to 2020, OPEC<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote3" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">3.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>could increase its capacity by, say, two million barrels a day above currently assumed increases, and new investments in mature assets could slow decline rates, leading to an additional one million to two million barrels of daily production. Furthermore, additional investments in unconventional oil sources, such as oil sands, could increase supply by, say, one million to two million barrels a day. Biofuels, too, would have room to grow. But given the time it would take to pursue some of the available opportunities&mdash;and the danger that they could quickly become uneconomic once oil prices fell&mdash;the supply response is likely to be slower and more muted than that of demand. </p>
<p>In the end, once all the efficiency gains and supply expansions described above kicked in, the world could again wind up in balance and with significant excess capacity, so that eventually&mdash;perhaps by 2020, perhaps later&mdash;prices fell below the $80 to $100 range. Until then, however, given how slowly many of the demand changes would unfold, it&rsquo;s only prudent to imagine the possibility that the world could experience a prolonged period of both significant volatility and generally much higher prices. </p>
<h3>Preparing for the unexpected</h3>
<p>If the shock scenario outlined above unfolded, sustained high oil prices would challenge the top and bottom lines of many companies. However, high prices also could create opportunities for companies to differentiate themselves from competitors whose cost structures and operating approaches were ill suited to the new environment. And for companies on the front lines of the resource productivity revolution, a prolonged oil price increase would be beneficial. Providers of a range of new technologies&mdash;from car batteries for electric vehicles, to horizontal drilling and other tools for unconventional oil extraction, to biofuel production techniques, to electricity cogeneration equipment for manufacturers&mdash;would see their businesses grow, faster, than they would in a world of lower oil prices. </p>
<p>In many cases, these companies would be supplying or partnering with more established firms: oil companies in need of unconventional extraction technologies, auto manufacturers trying to create the winning vehicle of the future, and chemical companies hoping to take advantage of new feedstock sources, for example. From a strategic perspective, the interesting question is who would grab the most profitable positions in the new energy ecosystem.</p>
<p>No less fascinating are the managerial implications of the second-order and feedback effects that would occur as this ferocious collision played itself out. For example, our analysis suggests that even if prices subsequently fell, companies that pursued strategies for reducing their dependence on oil would be unlikely to regret it. One reason is that many strategies are already &ldquo;in the money&rdquo; at today&rsquo;s prices. If prices got high enough, they would concentrate the attention of consumers, businesses, and governments sufficiently to promote many positive-return investments that haven&rsquo;t been implemented so far, because of behavioral inertia. This development would accelerate the changes in our capital stock, while leaving them economically viable even if prices fell again. </p>
<p>Furthermore, many technologies could become significantly cheaper as demand for them increased and their providers went down learning curves. Examples include batteries for vehicles, highly efficient internal-combustion engines, and certain biofuel technologies, such as those that are cellulosic or perhaps even based on algae. In a high-price environment, more capital would flow into these technologies, enabling them to scale up. The time needed for them to become economically attractive would fall by five or even ten years compared with the time frame if oil prices stayed at lower levels, potentially making these technologies economically viable even if oil prices subsequently fell.</p>
<p>Indeed, a striking and often-underestimated feature of energy price shocks is the nonlinearity of their impact. Take electric vehicles. The market for car batteries would likely be about five or ten times larger if oil prices stayed for a considerable period at $150 a barrel than it would be at $100 a barrel. Few corporate-planning processes, however, place sufficient emphasis on extremes like this&mdash;even though these are precisely the scenarios that produce many of the most interesting opportunities and powerful threats for a business. Building corporate processes and skills that enable thoughtful reflection on a wider, more volatile range of outcomes could be a significant competitive differentiator in the years to come.</p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>In the long run, these structural changes could well be a positive development for the world&mdash;resulting in more predictable and sustainable energy supplies and prices. But navigating the transition would be challenging and would reward the well prepared. The time is now for companies to start planning for the possibility of another price shock and a powerful market response.</p>

<strong>Retailers and</strong> consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) companies have long had access to vast amounts of transaction data: every day, companies capture information about every SKU sold to every customer at every store. In addition, companies regularly use sophisticated market-research techniques to answer a variety of questions: what products should we develop and sell? How much is the customer willing to pay? Which products should we discount and when? Which marketing vehicles will allow us to reach the most customers?</p>

Adding to the reams of data and market research already at their fingertips, consumer companies now have access to social-media information and other large data sets known as big data. In this article, we discuss the potential of big data and advanced analytics for the retail and CPG industries and examine what it takes to turn this potential into actual value.</p>

 
<h3>Immense possibilities</h3>

<p>
The combination of big data and advanced analytics offers retail and CPG companies countless opportunities across the value chain. In portfolio strategy and product development, for example, companies can get a more detailed understanding of consumer needs and attitudes and more precisely identify consumer segments, improving their ability to target the highest-value opportunities. They can measure the return on investment (ROI) for marketing spend across both traditional and newer marketing vehicles (such as social media), allowing them to shift marketing dollars to the most effective channels (see sidebar, &ldquo;Unraveling the Web: A new way to understand the online customer&rdquo;). Through detailed hourly analysis of in-stock rates by store, retailers can reduce out-of-stocks, provide a better shopping experience for consumers, and boost sales for both themselves and their CPG partners.</p>

<p>
Consumer-facing companies seeking to measure Web-site performance need to understand how well connected their site is to all the sites that influence purchasing decisions for their products, such as blogs and review sites. Simple &ldquo;clickstream&rdquo; analyses of how customers use and navigate to and from a company&rsquo;s Web site neglect a substantial set of other influences that bear on today&rsquo;s multitasking, site-hopping consumers who check e-mails, update their social network status, and catch up on the news&mdash;sometimes taking days to decide what to buy.</p>

<p>
For the past several years, we have tapped a panel of about 11,000 online users, broadly representative of the vast US online population. We log all the sites that these users visit during a six-month period. When a disproportionate number of users click on any two sites within a given period, typically a week, we consider the pairs to be connected. We collect all such pairs for companies, information providers, and others in a given industry.</p>

<p>
We present these relationships in a network map, which enables us to discern, at a granular level, a given company&rsquo;s network. The number of nodes and the length of the lines reflect the strength of the network. Short lines mean a strong connection; long lines represent a weak one. Strong connectivity implies significant overlap among their visitors, meaning the influencer is likely generating traffic for the connected site, even when users do not click directly from the influencer site to the connected site.</p>

The exhibit shows a network map of five online consumer-electronics retailers. Visitors to electronics retailers are likely to visit technology review, media, and news sites, among others. Retailer A has two strong influencer sites, while its competitors Retailer B and Retailer C have many more connections with influencer sites. This indicates that A could strengthen its relationships with influencer sites and boost traffic from them by investing in creative content partnerships, social media, and advertising. Companies can use influencer maps as they think about redistributing online advertising dollars to optimize connections with the sites that generate the most traffic. They can also marry this data with demographic information on customers to recognize those influencer sites that reach their desired customer segments.</p>

Big data and advanced analytics allow companies to make better, faster decisions in their day-to-day business and deliver improved performance. A European CPG company, for instance, revolutionized its retailer-specific assortments and planograms: by applying advanced analytics to consumer data, it was able to determine which SKUs were selling well in which retail formats and which SKUs to swap in and out to best meet consumer preferences. It is now seeing 10 percent sales growth in a low-growth category. And the potential impact isn&rsquo;t just in sales: recent research by McKinsey and Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows that companies that inject big data and analytics into their operations outperform their peers by 5 percent in productivity and 6 percent in profitability.<a class="link-footnote" rel="#footnote1" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" onclick="return false;"><sup>1</sup></a> <span id="footnote1" class="tooltip" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text">

<h3>Making it happen: Three ingredients</h3> 
<p>
We have found that fully exploiting data and analytics requires three capabilities. First, companies must be able to choose the right data and manage multiple data sources. Second, they need the capability to build advanced models that turn the data into insights. Third and most critical, management must undertake a transformational-change program so that the insights translate into effective action. (For more, see &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/putting_big_data_and_advanced_analytics_to_work">Putting big data and advanced analytics to work</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/making_data_analytics_work">Making data analytics work: Three key challenges</a>.&rdquo;)</p>

 
<h6>Managing the data</h6>

<p>
As they embark on a data-and-analytics journey, companies should take a &ldquo;decision back&rdquo; approach that begins by crisply answering one question: which decisions do we want to improve? A retailer may, for instance, seek to make better decisions about its promotional spending. Here, the range of decisions can be quite broad: do we want to optimize the design (number of pages, number of products on each page) of our promotional leaflets and circulars? Do we want to reassess the distribution of our circulars&mdash;which newspapers they should be inserted into, which addresses they should be delivered to, and so on? Do we want to rethink the product mix in our circulars? Each decision requires different data and analyses.</p>

<p>
Once they&rsquo;ve determined the specific business decisions they want to improve, consumer companies must collect and manage the data needed to conduct insightful analysis. In our experience, this entails three deliberate actions: creatively sourcing data, defining data-governance standards, and establishing an IT infrastructure.</p>

 

 
<p><em>Creatively source data</em>. Often, we find that a consumer company has the data it needs to unlock business improvement, but the data reside in different business groups within the company. In effect, organizational silos &ldquo;hide&rdquo; data from the analysts who can put it to work.</p>

<p>
For example, a specialty retailer sought to redesign the promotional mailings it sends to the more than five million members of its loyalty-card program. While the program had been successful, revenue and profit from loyal customers was stagnating. The retailer recognized that by combining data from various functional groups&mdash;in this case, customer loyalty, marketing, and merchandising finance&mdash;it could identify subsegments among its loyal customers and figure out what types of direct mail resulted in the most incremental profit for each segment. Once the retailer understood what data it needed, it developed a focused process to extract and clean the needed data and bring it together for this new purpose. We find that such a targeted approach often leads to success and supports quick wins.</p>

 
 

<p>
<em>Define data-governance standards.</em> Given the vast amount of data that retail and CPG companies collect and manage, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data is a constant challenge. For instance, product information&mdash;package sizes, product descriptions, or even the category in which a product belongs&mdash;isn&rsquo;t always up-to-date in retailers&rsquo; databases. If the data are needed for analysis, the old saying &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; still largely applies.</p>

<p>
The increasing value of analysis-ready data mandates a mind-set shift: in particular, a shift from simply collecting the most easily available information and storing it as is, to establishing rigorous data-governance standards that call for clean, consistent data to be collected and stored in an analysis-ready state. The approach can be quite similar to the way retailers manage and maintain stores: they have processes and checks in place to ensure that store assets are properly cleaned, well designed, and periodically refurbished to maintain their useful life. In the same way, data-governance standards should define what data will be collected, the processes for checking and maintaining the data, and who in the organization is responsible for managing each data set.</p>

 
 

<p>
<em>Establish the IT infrastructure.</em> Companies need the IT infrastructure to store, easily access, combine, and analyze large data sets. Setting up the IT infrastructure requires close collaboration among business managers, analysts, and IT staff to ensure that data storage is designed in a way that meets business needs and technical IT requirements.</p>

<p>
One large retailer has taken big steps that improve data accessibility. The retailer recently announced plans to integrate its five-plus e-commerce Web sites onto one platform and move the corresponding data into a single in-house data repository. Whereas today sourcing of e-commerce data requires coordination across groups and can take several weeks, the new infrastructure will give the retailer&rsquo;s business leaders instant transparency and access to e-commerce data, accelerating insight generation and business impact.</p>

 
<h6>Translating data into insights</h6>

<p>
Managing the data is just the first step. Companies must next make sense of the flood of data&mdash;a task that requires sophisticated and sometimes complex analytic models. Two guiding principles can help. First, business users should be involved in the model-building process; they must understand the analytics and ensure that the model yields actionable results. Second, the modeling approach should aim for the least complex model that will deliver the needed insights.</p>

<p>
The power of these two steps became evident in a CPG company&rsquo;s efforts to assess its marketing-spend ROI. An external vendor independently built a model that suggested online paid-search ads delivered incredibly high ROI. The CPG company&rsquo;s marketing executives were surprised but trusted the results, even though they didn&rsquo;t understand the model. Later, the company&rsquo;s internal insights group partnered with the marketing function and built its own simplified model. The results were markedly different: this model showed ROI for paid-search ads to be 15 times lower than what the vendor&rsquo;s model estimated. Further investigation revealed that one of the external company&rsquo;s analysts, who had no knowledge of the business, had grouped the data erroneously&mdash;a mistake that a business practitioner would have easily caught. Moreover, the complexities of the vendor&rsquo;s model hid the error from view.</p>

 
<h6>Turning insights into effective frontline action</h6>

<p>
Gathering the right data and developing transparent models, however, won&rsquo;t yield impact unless companies can also turn data-driven insights into effective action on the front line. Companies must define new processes in a way that managers and frontline workers can readily understand and adopt. When a large CPG manufacturer implemented a new demand-forecasting system that generated automatic forecasts of each retail customer&rsquo;s inventory needs, sales managers weren&rsquo;t told that the new process included shipping of safety stock to every customer. Worried that their customers weren&rsquo;t receiving adequate stock, sales managers regularly overwrote the automatic forecasts. It took months before they changed their behavior and trusted the new system.</p>

<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>
We see great potential for consumer-facing organizations that adopt big data and advanced analytics as a platform for growth. Done right, a data-and-analytics initiative can yield outsize rewards for retailers and CPG companies alike.</p>

<p><strong>Just</strong> to keep pace with projected global growth between now and 2030, the world will have to spend $57 trillion on roads, bridges, ports, power plants, water facilities, and other forms of infrastructure. That&rsquo;s nearly 60 percent above the amount spent in the last 18 years and more than the estimated value of today&rsquo;s infrastructure. To deconstruct the problem of insufficient or inadequate infrastructure and to rethink the financing and delivery of better projects at lower cost, this package convenes an ongoing dialogue among global experts in construction, organization, funding, logistics, and government relations.</p>

<p>Improving the design, financing, and delivery of infrastructure on a global scale doesn&rsquo;t call for reinventing the wheel. <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/insights/engineering_construction/infrastructure_productivity">Infrastructure productivity: How to save $1 trillion a year</a></em>, a report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) and McKinsey&rsquo;s infrastructure practice, shows how practical steps can boost productivity in the sector&mdash;a long-time laggard&mdash;to achieve critical cost savings.</p>
<p>A related slideshow examines the challenge of investing in infrastructure at a time of high government deficits and explains the savings that productivity gains can provide. And in a group of video interviews, authorities such as former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright; Rockefeller Foundation president Judith Rodin; Raymond Ch&rsquo;ien, chairman of Hong Kong&rsquo;s MTR Corporation; Mark Wiseman, chief executive of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board; and others explore how efforts to rethink infrastructure can improve projects, partnerships, and outcomes for society in addressing one of the world&rsquo;s most urgent issues.</p>

The survey received 4,261 responses in 2011, 3,249 responses in 2010, 1,695 responses in 2009, 1,988 responses in 2008, and 2,847 responses in 2007. The &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; results were calculated based on all respondents who were using any social (or Web 2.0) technology for the particular purpose indicated (for example, lowering purchasing costs). Each percentage represents the proportion of these respondents who are using a particular technology for a particular purpose and offers a useful way of comparing the relative importance of each technology.
</span><span class="clear"></span> </span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span> on how organizations are using social ( or Web 2.0) technologies. In 2009 we created an interactive  tool that links the data from these survey results and charts it to the emerging trends in Web 2.0 adoption.</p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p>
This interactive focuses on several of the survey&rsquo;s core questions&mdash;from what technologies and tools companies view as most important to what kind of investments, if any, organizations plan to make in Web 2.0 in the future. Our most recent survey  examines the business use of 13 social technologies and tools: blogs, collaborative document editing, mash-ups (a Web application that combines multiple sources of data into a single tool), microblogging, online videoconferencing, podcasts, prediction markets, rating, RSS (Really Simple Syndication), social networking, tagging, video sharing, and wikis. </p>
<p>
Using the interactive, you can track the performance of each technology through the years or customize the view to compare particular technologies side by side. The interactive also contains an audio guide from Michael Chui&mdash;a consultant with McKinsey and one of the drivers of the Web 2.0 research initiative&mdash;who takes you further inside the results and trends.</p>
<p>
This interactive archive will evolve from year to year as the survey progresses and as businesses continue to evaluate their use of and satisfaction with Web 2.0. </p>

<p><strong>Historically,</strong> the infrastructure industry has been resistant to innovation and productivity gains, in part because of the piecemeal approach to many projects. In this video, Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, describes her philanthropy&rsquo;s push to plan projects systematically and to combine various elements holistically, including the use of natural &ldquo;soft&rdquo; infrastructure assets, such as forests, alongside &ldquo;hard&rdquo; construction assets. She also explores the challenges to infrastructure planning posed by Asia&rsquo;s booming cities and growing middle classes. This interview was conducted by McKinsey&rsquo;s Rik Kirkland in Istanbul, Turkey, in November 2012. What follows is an edited transcript of her remarks.</p>
<p>For more on this topic, also read <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/insights/engineering_construction/infrastructure_productivity">Infrastructure productivity: How to save $1 trillion a year</a></em>, a report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).</p>
<h4>Interview transcript</h4>
<h3>Innovating through a holistic approach</h3>
<p>Rockefeller is always focused on innovation, right from its beginning. We think that one of the innovations in infrastructure is really taking a systems approach. And that means not thinking about a specific project, not thinking about a specific situation like &ldquo;water only&rdquo; or &ldquo;transport only&rdquo; or &ldquo;energy only,&rdquo; but really looking systemically around what kinds of infrastructure need to support healthy, active, accessible communities or nations. And with that innovative way of thinking, you actually do approach infrastructure differently.</p>
<p>You think about both &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; infrastructure holistically. Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to plant mangroves and think about coastal restoration than it is to build a seawall. Or at least when you&rsquo;re building hard infrastructure, to think about the soft infrastructure solutions. Sometimes it&rsquo;s better, now that we have those materials, to build your streets and sidewalks with material that&rsquo;s porous. The kind of porous material now is an innovation, because it allows the material to absorb water more quickly and release it more slowly. Sometimes it&rsquo;s preventing construction. We worked in Da Nang with the municipal government and it was very clear that construction that they had already permitted for new hotels on the beach would have flooded twice a year, back into the poorest communities right behind it.</p>
<p>And to their credit, they stopped the project. They moved where the hotels would be. They did some restoration for the poorer communities as well. So that&rsquo;s what we mean by a systemic, holistic approach. So everywhere that there is innovation, whether it&rsquo;s technological innovation or systems innovation, it&rsquo;s critical to apply that to thinking about how to develop infrastructure going forward.</p>
<h3>Anticipating the Asia challenge</h3>
<p>The huge demographic growth that we will see over the next 20 to 50 years will be in Asia, primarily in Asian cities. And so, 70 percent of that population growth will occur there. Often those cities are on river deltas or on fragile ecologies of one sort or another. And they will not be able to tolerate this kind of population growth that they will experience without intervention. Rockefeller&rsquo;s been working in what are called &ldquo;second tier&rdquo; cities&mdash;that is, cities that are not yet the size of Mumbai or Bangkok, but are predicted to be, in the relatively near term.</p>
<p>We do that because we think that we can intervene in their expansion plans. And so we work first with the town officials. All of the municipal government and often the state and national government participate in doing a vulnerability assessment. That will often include hydrology mapping and a variety of other assessment tools that allow them to understand what compromises they&rsquo;ll need to make, or not, in terms of their infrastructure planning.</p>
<p>And then we actually support the construction of a variety of both soft and hard infrastructure. Sometimes it&rsquo;s early warning systems, sometimes it&rsquo;s dams, intervening in dams above the city in ways that will prevent flooding. So you&rsquo;re working at a more regional level. One of the things we&rsquo;ve been struck by is how many of the municipalities in these regions don&rsquo;t have strong municipal governance. They also don&rsquo;t have municipal bonding authority. So working with them on how the financing structures and some innovative financing sources can be brought to bear has been another really important piece of the work.</p>

      <h3>Foreseeing the potential rise of Africa's economic lions</h3>
      <p>MGI's London-based Director Charles Roxburgh and South Africa-based Principal Arend Van Wamelen discuss the sources and staying power of Africa's economic growth, the continent's compelling business opportunities, and the rise of the African urban consumer.</p>

<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Africa's growth acceleration was widespread, with 27 of its 30 largest economies expanding more rapidly after 2000.</h3></p>
<p>All sectors contributed, including resources, finance, retail, agriculture, transportation and telecommunications. Natural resources directly accounted for just 24 percent of the continent's GDP growth from 2000 through 2008. Key to Africa's growth surge were improved political and macroeconomic stability and microeconomic reforms. </p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Future economic growth will be supported by Africa's increasing ties to the global economy.</h3></p>
<p>Rising demand for commodities is driving buyers around the world to pay dearly for Africa's natural riches and to forge new types of partnerships with producers. And Africa is gaining greater access to international capital; total foreign capital flows into Africa rose from $15 billion in 2000 to a peak of $87 billion in 2007. </p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Africa's economic growth is creating substantial new business opportunities that are often overlooked by global companies.</h3></p>
<p>MGI projects that at least four groups of industries&mdash;consumer-facing industries, agriculture, resources, and infrastructure&mdash;together could generate as much as $2.6 trillion in revenue annually by 2020, or $1 trillion more than today. </p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Today the rate of return on foreign investment in Africa is higher than in any other developing region.</h3></p>
<p>Early entry into African economies provides opportunities to create markets, establish brands, shape industry structures, influence customer preferences, and establish long-term relationships. Business can help build the Africa of the future.</p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>The rise of the African urban consumer also will fuel long-term growth.</h3></p>
<p>Today, 40 percent of Africans live in urban areas, a portion close to China's and continuing to expand. The number of households with discretionary income is projected to rise by 50 percent over the next 10 years, reaching 128 million. By 2030, the continent's top 18 cities could have combined spending power of $1.3 trillion. </p>
<p>To understand the growth opportunities and challenges of individual economies, MGI developed a framework that groups them in four broad clusters: diversified economies, oil exporters, transition economies, and pre-transition economies. Though imperfect, this framework can guide business leaders and investors developing strategies for the continent and policymakers working to sustain growth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

     <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/asia-pacific/china_e-tailing"/><p><strong>Almost overnight</strong>, China has become the world&rsquo;s second-largest e-tail market, with estimates as high as $210 billion for revenues in 2012 and a compound annual growth rate of 120 percent since 2003. The country&rsquo;s retail sector already is among the most wired anywhere&mdash;e-tailing commanded about 5 to 6 percent of total retail sales in 2012, compared with 5 percent in the United States&mdash;while it is distinctly different from that of other countries. Only a small portion of Chinese e-tailing takes place directly between consumers and retailers, whether online pure plays or brick-and-mortar businesses on retailers&rsquo; own Web sites. Instead, most occurs on digital marketplaces. What&rsquo;s more, Chinese e-tailing is not just replacing traditional retail transactions but also stimulating consumption that would not otherwise take place. Finally, e-tailing may catalyze a &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; move by the broader retail sector, putting it on a fast track to a more digital future. These are among the key findings of <em>China&rsquo;s e-tail revolution: Online shopping as a catalyst for growth</em>, a new report by the McKinsey Global Institute. </p>
<h3>Structural differences </h3>
<p>Some 90 percent of Chinese electronic retailing occurs on virtual marketplaces&mdash;sprawling e-commerce platforms where manufacturers, large and small retailers, and individuals offer products and services to consumers through online storefronts on megasites analogous to eBay or Amazon Marketplace.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1</span><span class="footnote-text">In the United States, marketplaces represent 20 to 30 percent of commerce.</span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span> The megasites include PaiPai, Taobao, and Tmall, which in turn are owned by bigger e-commerce groups. A large and growing network of third-party service providers offers sellers marketing and site-design services, payment fulfillment, delivery and logistics, customer service, and IT support. </p>
<p>By contrast, in the United States, Europe, and Japan, the dominant model involves brick-and-mortar retailers (such as Best Buy, Carrefour, Darty, Dixons, and Wal-mart) or pure-play online merchants (such as Amazon), which run their own sites and handle the details of commerce. Developed markets have major specialized retail chains in the e-commerce arena. In China, such independent merchants account for only 10 percent of e-tailing sales. Although still in the early stages of growth, China&rsquo;s e-tail ecosystem is profitable, logging margins of around 8 to 10 percent of earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization&mdash;slightly higher than those of average physical retailers. </p>
<h3>Powering consumption </h3>
<p>This unique e-tailing engine is enabling China&rsquo;s shift from an investment-oriented society to one that&rsquo;s more consumption driven. E-tailing, our research indicates, is not simply a replacement channel for purchases that otherwise would have taken place offline. Instead, it appears to be spurring incremental consumption, particularly in less developed regions. By analyzing consumption patterns in 266 Chinese cities accounting for over 70 percent of online retail sales, we found that a dollar of online consumption replaces roughly 60 cents of sales in offline stores and generates around 40 cents of incremental consumption (Exhibit 1). It&rsquo;s important to note that the data sets behind this analysis don&rsquo;t cover the full market. Our approximations do, however, provide a preliminary picture of what&rsquo;s occurring in China and permit a rough calculation of the extent to which e-tailing may be boosting consumption there. (These estimates suggest that the channel may have added 2 percent of incremental value to private consumption in 2011 and could generate 4 to 7 percent in incremental consumption by 2020.) </p>

      <p>Online spending raises China's total consumption—and the effect is even more pronounced in less developed areas.

</p>
<p>E-tailing&rsquo;s impact is more pronounced in China&rsquo;s underdeveloped small and midsize cities. We found that while incomes in these urban areas are lower, their online shoppers spend almost as much money online as do people in some larger, more prosperous cities&mdash;and also spend a larger portion of their disposable income online (Exhibit 2). For these shoppers, the utility of online purchasing may be higher, since they now have access to products and brands previously not available to them, in locations where many retailers have yet to establish beachheads. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    
</p>
<p>Further boosting online purchases is the fact that e-tailing has cut consumer prices: depending on the category, they are, on average, 6 to 16 percent lower online than in China&rsquo;s stores.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote2" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">2</span><span class="footnote-text">When adjusted for the portion of products common to both e-tailing and traditional retailing (measured in stock-keeping units, or SKUs), the price effect is lower: 4 to 9 percent.</span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span> Apparel, household products, and recreation and education are the categories where price discounts are greatest. They are also the three largest online retail segments (Exhibit 3). </p>

<h3>The leapfrog effect </h3>
<p>China&rsquo;s retailing industry, coming of age in an era of digital disruption, will probably follow a trajectory different from that of retail sectors in other markets. In developed nations, the industry typically followed a three-stage path. It began with the rise of regionally dominant players. This field then consolidated into a smaller number of national leaders. Eventually, online players challenged them, and the industry became multichannel. Some brick-and-mortar players (Tesco and Wal-Mart Stores, for instance) have embraced a multichannel strategy, while others (such as Borders in the United States and Jessops and Woolworths in the United Kingdom) have been driven from the market. </p>
<p>China differs from these developed markets, however, because a crop of national leaders has yet to emerge in traditional retailing. Building stores across China&rsquo;s considerable geography, with its many smaller cities, takes both time and high levels of investment. As a result, China&rsquo;s largest brick-and-mortar retailers have captured a smaller share of the country&rsquo;s overall retail market than have major players in the United States and elsewhere: the top five retailers by category hold less than 20 percent of the market&mdash;much lower than US levels of 24 to 60 percent in comparable categories. </p>
<p>In China, the combined effects of the complexities of store expansion and a distinctive model of e-tailing could lead to a different retail dynamic: as e-tailing continues to grow, China&rsquo;s industry may leapfrog the second (national) stage, passing directly from the regional to the multichannel one. In fact, China&rsquo;s online ecosystem of marketplaces and agile support services has grown rapidly precisely because it can exploit the inefficiencies and higher costs of China&rsquo;s existing retail market. Already, the major online companies Alibaba (which owns marketplaces such as Taobao) and 360buy.com (focusing on sales of electronics) have established a prominent national role, ranking among China&rsquo;s top ten retailers. </p>
<h3>Coming next</h3>
<p>The view forward may be more impressive. We estimate that by 2020, as 15 to 20 percent annual growth rates (before inflation) continue, e-tailing could generate $420 billion to $650 billion in sales, and China&rsquo;s market will equal that of the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France combined today.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote3" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">3</span><span class="footnote-text">This e-tailing market-size forecast is based on regression analysis of 17 countries from 2003 to 2011.</span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span> Patterns of future change are coming into focus. </p>
<p><em>Retail modernization </em></p>
<p>E-tailing will continue to transform the retail sector. As competition among e-tailers has lowered prices, it has also both increased the size of the consumer market and created efficiencies in the important adjacent markets that support e-commerce&mdash;logistics, supply chains, IT services, and digital marketing. This efficiency edge should force brick-and-mortar retailers to modernize and pave the way to a more efficient coordination of supply and demand across the Chinese economy. </p>
<p>One cloud hanging over the e-tailing scene is a growing talent shortage resulting from heady growth. Eventually, it could raise labor costs and hamper expansion plans unless e-tailers significantly improve their labor productivity, which at best matches that of physical retailers. The good news is that if the online ecosystem learns from developed markets, e-tailing&rsquo;s productivity should rise as high as two to four times that of offline retailers. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, China&rsquo;s store-based retailers, and the manufacturers that supply them, will need to place some new bets&mdash;soon. Many have yet to fully embrace multichannel strategies, focusing instead on the sizable growth and consolidation opportunities still available in their brick-and-mortar businesses. They&rsquo;ll have to decide whether to join existing e-tail marketplaces or establish their own online storefronts and whether to own parts of the value chain (such as distribution and IT) or use third-party suppliers. </p>
<p><em>To what extent will e-tailers bypass virtual marketplaces?</em> </p>
<p>As the e-tail ecosystem diversifies and matures, merchants that today use digital marketplaces may find it tempting to pursue growth by operating independently. To do so, these companies must go beyond current strategies, which depend chiefly on products and prices, where competition already is fierce. Instead, to build a strong online brand, e-tailers will need to dedicate management resources and investments to creating an attractive package of value propositions&mdash;superior customer service, fast and reliable delivery, a better shopping experience, or more targeted marketing. That will require a new level of capabilities and, perhaps, partnerships with experienced players outside China. </p>
<p><em>Consumer companies: Threats and opportunities</em> </p>
<p>Since marketplaces hold the leading share of China&rsquo;s e-tailing market, they are a natural place for consumer-products manufacturers to focus when they enter China&mdash;or grow outside its leading cities. Marketplace ecosystems provide a business infrastructure to reach customers at a reasonable cost. That infrastructure is particularly valuable for new entrants, which may find it an economical way of testing a market&rsquo;s temperature. Uniqlo, for one, used a combination of marketplaces and service providers when it started its online apparel business in China in 2009. </p>
<p>At the same time, however, e-tailing innovation is creating more competition. New entrants have sprung up on the major e-tail marketplaces (known as Taobrands on the Taobao marketplace) to sell lines such as apparel and cosmetics directly to consumers. With products sourced straight from workshops and OEM factories, and sales stimulated by targeted marketing campaigns, these immensely popular companies offer good quality and attractive prices. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, China&rsquo;s model and innovations are spilling beyond its borders. Other emerging economies are developing e-tailing markets that could follow China&rsquo;s business model&mdash;and potentially achieve similar growth rates. China&rsquo;s new marketplace sellers are expanding internationally, leveraging their direct access to Chinese workshops and OEM factories. Global consumer-goods players should be ready to face competition from Chinese small and midsize enterprises and microbusinesses selling directly through marketplaces in emerging economies. </p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>China may have largely sat out the 19th-century Industrial Revolution, but as the explosion of its new consuming class continues to reshape 21st-century economic life, e-tailing and the Internet revolution have important roles to play. E-tailing is boosting the Chinese consumer&rsquo;s propensity to spend. The distinctive course charted by the country&rsquo;s e-tailers is having an impact on merchants, consumer-product companies, and value-chain partners. And it&rsquo;s widening the field of opportunities for players both in and outside China. With continued robust growth, changes in industry business patterns that are already under way will only grow in importance. </p>

Other developments&mdash;such as advances by local companies in domestically oriented consumer electronics, instant messaging, and online gaming&mdash;may well be escaping the notice of executives who aren&rsquo;t on the ground in China.</p>
<p>As innovation gains steam there, the stakes are rising for domestic and multinational companies alike. Prowess in innovation will not only become an increasingly important differentiator inside China but should also yield ideas and products that become serious competitors on the international stage.</p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p>Chinese companies and multinationals bring different strengths and weaknesses to this competition. The Chinese have traditionally had a bias toward innovation through commercialization&mdash;they are more comfortable than many Western companies are with putting a new product or service into the market quickly and improving its performance through subsequent generations. It is common for products to launch in a fraction of the time that it would take in more developed markets. While the quality of these early versions may be variable, subsequent ones improve rapidly.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Commercialization differs from <i>shanzhai</i>, or &ldquo;copycat innovation.&rdquo; Many executives in the developed world misunderstand <i>shanzhai</i>, believing that it is purely the replication of an innovation developed in another market. Although this does occur, products developed through the <i>shanzhai</i> approach incorporate features specifically for the Chinese market. <i>Shanzhai</i> is quite prevalent in consumer products categories such as packaged goods and electronics. It can also be found in the business-to-business domain, where local companies produce knockoffs of successful foreign products or business models. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span></p>
<p>Chinese companies also benefit from their government&rsquo;s emphasis on indigenous innovation, underlined in the latest five-year plan. Chinese authorities view innovation as critical both to the domestic economy&rsquo;s long-term health and to the global competitiveness of Chinese companies. China has already created the seeds of 22 Silicon Valley&ndash;like innovation hubs within the life sciences and biotech industries. In semiconductors, the government has been consolidating innovation clusters to create centers of manufacturing excellence.</p>
<p>But progress isn&rsquo;t uniform across industries, and innovation capabilities vary significantly: several basic skills are at best nascent within a typical Chinese enterprise. Pain points include an absence of advanced techniques for understanding&mdash;analytically, not just intuitively&mdash;what customers really want, corporate cultures that don&rsquo;t support risk taking, and a scarcity of the sort of internal collaboration that&rsquo;s essential for developing new ideas.</p>

In innovative sectors such as biotechnology, electric vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and solar energy, the number of patent applications from Chinese companies is rising. In fact, Huawei and ZTE ranked among the world’s top five corporate patent registrants by volume in 2010. Intensifying patent activity reflects a growing recognition that intellectual property is essential to value. As this mentality takes hold, domestic innovators may pressure the government to create a more modern intellectual-property system.</p><p>
Currently, China recognizes three categories of patents: invention (what most people elsewhere think of as worthy of a patent), utility (a new use for something that already exists), and design. Invention patents run for 20 years, the others only for 10. Patent reform—such as reducing the duration of design or utility patents and raising the bar for what can be registered in those categories—would be a powerful way for the Chinese government to signal its seriousness about promoting indigenous innovation. If China decides to move ahead with patent reform, a desire for global consistency could well make it a high-priority multilateral issue.</p><p>Without patent reform, companies must rely on one of two strategies for protecting intellectual property. The first is to continue to outrun the competition by developing increasingly innovative solutions or building in protection through complex integration that is difficult to reverse-engineer. The second is to create easily identifiable technology “signatures” that would be hard to refute in legal proceedings.</p></td></tr>

<p>Multinationals are far stronger in these areas but face other challenges, such as high attrition among talented Chinese nationals that can slow efforts to create local innovation centers. Indeed, the contrasting capabilities of domestic and multinational players, along with the still-unsettled state of intellectual-property protection (see sidebar, &ldquo;Improving the patent process&rdquo;), create the potential for topsy-turvy competition, creative partnerships, and rapid change. This article seeks to lay out the current landscape for would-be innovators and to describe some of the priorities for domestic and multinational companies that hope to thrive in it.</p>
<h3>China&rsquo;s innovation landscape</h3>
<p>Considerable innovation is occurring in China in both the business- to-consumer and business-to-business sectors. Although breakthroughs in either space generally go unrecognized by the broader global public, many multinational B2B competitors are acutely aware of the innovative strides the Chinese are making in sectors such as communications equipment and alternative energy. Interestingly, even as multinationals struggle to cope with Chinese innovation in some areas, they seem to be holding their own in others.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">The business-to-consumer visibility gap</h3>
<p>When European and US consumers think about what China makes, they reflexively turn to basic items such as textiles and toys, not necessarily the most innovative products and rarely associated with brand names.</p>
<p>In fact, though, much product innovation in China stays there. A visit to a shop of the Suning Appliance chain, the large Chinese consumer electronics retailer, is telling. There, you might find an Android-enabled television complete with an integrated Internet-browsing capability and preloaded apps that take users straight to some of the most popular Chinese Web sites and digital movie-streaming services. Even the picture quality and industrial design are comparable to those of high-end televisions from South Korean competitors.</p>
<p>We observe the same home-grown innovation in business models. Look, for example, at the online sector, especially Tencent&rsquo;s QQ instant-messaging service and the Sina Corporation&rsquo;s microblog, Weibo. These models, unique to China, are generating revenue and growing in ways that have not been duplicated anywhere in the world. QQ&rsquo;s low, flat-rate pricing and active marketplace for online games generate tremendous value from hundreds of millions of Chinese users.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s keeping innovative products and business models confined to China? In general, its market is so large that domestic companies have little incentive to adapt successful products for sale abroad. In many cases, the skills and capabilities of these companies are oriented toward the domestic market, so even if they want to expand globally, they face high hurdles. Many senior executives, for example, are uncomfortable doing business outside their own geography and language. Furthermore, the success of many Chinese models depends on local resources&mdash;for example, lower-cost labor, inexpensive land, and access to capital or intellectual property&mdash;that are difficult to replicate elsewhere. Take the case of mobile handsets: most Chinese manufacturers would be subject to significant intellectual property&ndash;driven licensing fees if they sold their products outside China.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Successes in business to business</h3>
<p>Several Chinese B2B sectors are establishing a track record of innovation domestically and globally. The Chinese communications equipment industry, for instance, is a peer of developed-world companies in quality. Market acceptance has expanded well beyond the historical presence in emerging markets to include Europe&rsquo;s most demanding customers, such as France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and Vodafone.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals are another area where China has made big strides. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country was a bit player in the discovery of new chemical entities. By the next decade, however, China&rsquo;s sophistication had grown dramatically. More than 20 chemical compounds discovered and developed in China are currently undergoing clinical trials.</p>

<p>China&rsquo;s solar- and wind-power industries are also taking center stage. The country will become the world&rsquo;s largest market for renewable-energy technology, and it already has some of the sector&rsquo;s biggest companies, providing critical components for the industry globally. Chinese companies not only enjoy scale advantages but also, in the case of solar, use new manufacturing techniques to improve the efficiency of solar panels.</p>
<p>Success in B2B innovation has benefited greatly from friendly government policies, such as establishing market access barriers; influencing the nature of cross-border collaborations by setting intellectual-property requirements in electric vehicles, high-speed trains, and other segments; and creating domestic-purchasing policies that favor Chinese-made goods and services. Many view these policies as loading the dice in favor of Chinese companies, but multinationals should be prepared for their continued enforcement.</p>

<p>Despite recent setbacks, an interesting example of how the Chinese government has moved to build an industry comes from high-speed rail. Before 2004, China&rsquo;s efforts to develop it had limited success. Since then, a mix of two policies&mdash;encouraging technology transfer from multinationals (in return for market access) and a coordinated R&amp;D-investment effort&mdash;has helped China Railways&rsquo; high-speed trains to dominate the local industry. The multinationals&rsquo; revenue in this sector has remained largely unchanged since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country&rsquo;s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What&rsquo;s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have <i>not</i> been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Advantage, multinationals?</h3>
<p>Simultaneously, multinationals have been shaping China&rsquo;s innovation landscape by leveraging global assets. Consider, for example, the joint venture between General Motors and the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, which adapted a US minivan (Buick&rsquo;s GL8) for use in the Chinese market and more recently introduced a version developed in China, for China. The model has proved hugely popular among executives.</p>
<p>In fact, the market for vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines remains dominated by multinationals, despite significant incentives and encouragement from the Chinese government, which had hoped that some domestic automakers would emerge as leaders by now. The continued strength of multinationals indicates how hard it is to break through in industries with 40 or 50 years of intellectual capital. Transferring the skills needed to design and manufacture complex engineering systems has proved a significant challenge requiring mentorship, the right culture, and time.</p>
<p>We are seeing the emergence of similar challenges in electric vehicles, where early indications suggest that the balance is swinging toward the multinationals because of superior product quality. By relying less on purely indigenous innovation, China is trying to make sure the electric-vehicle story has an ending different from that of its telecommunications protocol efforts. The government&rsquo;s stated aspiration of having more than five million plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles on the road by 2020 is heavily supported by a mix of extensive subsidies and tax incentives for local companies, combined with strict market access rules for foreign companies and the creation of new revenue pools through government and public fleet-purchase programs. But the subsidies and incentives may not be enough to overcome the technical challenges of learning to build these vehicles, particularly if multinationals decline to invest with local companies.</p>
<h3>Four priorities for innovators in China</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no magic formula for innovation&mdash;and that goes doubly for China, where the challenges and opportunities facing domestic and multinational players are so different. Some of the priorities we describe here, such as instilling a culture of risk taking and learning, are more pressing for Chinese companies. Others, such as retaining local talent, may be harder for multinationals. Collectively, these priorities include some of the critical variables that will influence which companies lead China&rsquo;s innovation revolution and how far it goes.</p>

<p class="grayNote small">A Chinese-built high-speed train at the Wuhan Railway Station, in Wuhan, China.<br>&copy; Guo Xulei/Xinhua Press/Corbis</p><h3 class="sm black">Deeply understanding Chinese customers</h3>
<p>Alibaba&rsquo;s Web-based trading platform, Taobao, is a great example of a product that emerged from deep insights into how customers were underserved and their inability to connect with suppliers, as well as a sophisticated understanding of the Chinese banking system. This dominant marketplace enables thousands of Chinese manufacturers to find and transact with potential customers directly. What looks like a straightforward eBay-like trading platform actually embeds numerous significant innovations to support these transactions, such as an ability to facilitate electronic fund transfers and to account for idiosyncrasies in the national banking system. Taobao wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without Alibaba&rsquo;s deep, analytically driven understanding of customers.</p>
<p>Few Chinese companies have the systematic ability to develop a deep understanding of customers&rsquo; problems. Domestic players have traditionally had a manufacturing-led focus on reapplying existing business models to deliver products for fast-growing markets. These &ldquo;push&rdquo; models will find it increasingly hard to unlock pockets of profitable growth. Shifting from delivery to creation requires more local research and development, as well as the nurturing of more market-driven organizations that can combine insights into detailed Chinese customer preferences with a clear sense of how the local business environment is evolving. Requirements include both research techniques relevant to China and people with the experience to draw out actionable customer insights.</p>
<p>Many multinationals have these capabilities, but unless they have been operating in China for some years, they may well lack the domestic-market knowledge or relationships needed to apply them effectively. The solution&mdash;building a true domestic Chinese presence rather than an outpost&mdash;sounds obvious, but it&rsquo;s difficult to carry out without commitment from the top. Too many companies fail by using &ldquo;fly over&rdquo; management. But some multinationals appear to be investing the necessary resources; for example, we recently met (separately) with top executives of two big industrial companies who were being transferred from the West to run global R&amp;D organizations from Shanghai. The idea is to be closer to Chinese customers and the network of institutions and universities from which multinationals source talent.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Retaining local talent</h3>
<p>China&rsquo;s universities graduate more than 10,000 science PhDs each year, and increasing numbers of Chinese scientists working overseas are returning home. Multinationals in particular are struggling to tap this inflow of researchers and managers. A recent survey by the executive-recruiting firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles found that 77 percent of the senior executives from multinational companies responding say they have difficulty attracting managers in China, while 91 percent regard employee turnover as their top talent challenge.</p>
<p>Retention is more of an issue for multinationals than for domestic companies, but as big foreign players raise their game, so must local ones. Chinese companies, for example, excel at creating a community-like environment to build loyalty to the institution. That helps keep some employees in place when competing offers arise, but it may not always be enough.</p>
<p>Talented Chinese employees increasingly recognize the benefits of being associated with a well-known foreign brand and like the mentorship and training that foreign companies can provide. So multinationals that commit themselves to developing meaningful career paths for Chinese employees should have a chance in the growing fight with their Chinese competitors for R&amp;D talent. Initiatives might include in-house training courses or apprenticeship programs, perhaps with local universities. General Motors sponsors projects in which professors and engineering departments at leading universities research issues of interest to the automaker. That helps it to develop closer relations with the institutions from which it recruits and to train students before they graduate.</p>
<p>Some multinationals energize Chinese engineers by shifting their roles from serving as capacity in a support of existing global programs to contributing significantly to new innovation thrusts, often aimed at the local market. This approach, increasingly common in the pharma industry, may hold lessons for other kinds of multinationals that have established R&amp;D or innovation centers in China in recent years (read about&nbsp;AstraZeneca&rsquo;s experience in &ldquo;Three snapshots of Chinese innovation&rdquo;). The keys to success include a clear objective&mdash; for instance, will activity support global programs or develop China-for-China innovations?&mdash;and a clear plan for attracting and retaining the talent needed to staff such centers. Too often, we visit impressive R&amp;D facilities, stocked with the latest equipment, that are almost empty because staffing them has proved difficult.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Instilling a culture of risk taking</h3>
<p>Failure is a required element of innovation, but it isn&rsquo;t the norm in China, where a culture of obedience and adherence to rules prevails in most companies. Breaking or even bending them is not expected and rarely tolerated. To combat these attitudes, companies must find ways to make initiative taking more acceptable and better rewarded.</p>
<p>One approach we found, in a leading solar company, was to transfer risk from individual innovators to teams. Shared accountability and community support made increased risk taking and experimentation safer. The company has used these &ldquo;innovation work groups&rdquo; to develop everything from more efficient battery technology to new manufacturing processes. Team-based approaches also have proved effective for some multinationals trying to stimulate initiative taking (read about&nbsp;General Motors&rsquo; approach in &ldquo;Three snapshots of Chinese innovation&rdquo;).</p>
<p>How fast a culture of innovation takes off varies by industry. We see a much more rapid evolution toward the approach of Western companies in the way Chinese high-tech enterprises learn from their customers and how they apply that learning to create new products made for China (read a perspective on the&nbsp;evolution of its semiconductor sector in &ldquo;Thee snapshots of Chinese innovation&rdquo;). That approach is much less common at state-owned enterprises, since they are held back by hierarchical, benchmark-driven cultures.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Promoting collaboration</h3>
<p>One area where multinationals currently have an edge is promoting collaboration and the internal collision of ideas, which can yield surprising new insights and business opportunities. In many Chinese companies, traditional organizational and cultural barriers inhibit such exchanges.</p>
<p>Although a lot of these companies have become more professional and adept at delivering products in large volumes, their ability to scale up an organization that can work collaboratively has not kept pace. Their rigorous, linear processes for bringing new products to market ensure rapid commercialization but create too many hand-offs where insights are lost and trade-offs for efficiency are promoted.</p>
<p>One Chinese consumer electronics company has repeatedly tried to improve the way it innovates. Senior management has called for new ideas and sponsored efforts to create new best-in-class processes, while junior engineers have designed high-quality prototypes. Yet the end result continues to be largely undifferentiated, incremental improvements. The biggest reason appears to be a lack of cross-company collaboration and a reliance on processes designed to build and reinforce scale in manufacturing. In effect, the technical and commercial sides of the business don&rsquo;t cooperate in a way that would allow some potentially winning ideas to reach the market. As Chinese organizations mature, stories like this one may become rarer.</p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>China hasn&rsquo;t yet experienced a true innovation revolution. It will need time to evolve from a country of incremental innovation based on technology transfers to one where breakthrough innovation is common. The government will play a powerful role in that process, but ultimately it will be the actions of domestic companies and multinationals that dictate the pace of change&mdash;and determine who leads it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/copy_of_br_sample_code"/><p><strong>Public-sector entities,</strong> like many commercial ones, are increasingly undertaking large transformation programs to streamline and improve their core operations. Nowhere is this task more challenging than in the US Department of Defense (DoD), which is committed to transforming its business practices to support faster and more agile operations. This multiyear mission will touch all aspects of the DoD, which has annual net operating costs exceeding $620 billion&mdash;including more than $30 billion for technology&mdash;2.9 million people, and a supply chain involving 5.2 million items.</p>
<p>[[exhibit exhibit 3]]</p>
<p>
In 2005, the DoD established the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) to help guide transformation efforts throughout the department. The BTA&rsquo;s responsibilities include deploying enterprise IT systems, publishing the Business Enterprise Architecture, and helping to carry out investment decisions. The agency, for example, oversees programs that manage pay and travel for the armed services, makes proposals to organizations such as the army and the navy (called &ldquo;components&rdquo; inside the Pentagon) about how they can transform themselves most effectively, and encourages standardization throughout the department.</p>
