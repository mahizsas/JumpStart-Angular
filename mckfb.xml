However, a 2012 McKinsey survey on business technology in China, undertaken in collaboration with Peking University, finds that Chinese enterprises continue to spend less than their global counterparts when it comes to IT investment. What’s more, many Chinese CEOs and business leaders view their IT function as good at helping to <em>run</em> the business but not strong at helping to <em>grow</em> it.</p>
<p>Indeed, the results of the survey show the majority of corporate IT investment in China remains skewed toward improving operational efficiency. Comparatively little investment is directed to delivering customer-facing, top-line pursuits. Such pursuits could include digital-sales channels tapping big-data analytics to improve the customer experience (Exhibit 1) or leveraging social media for marketing of products and services.</p>

<p>This will need to change as Chinese businesses expand globally and as pressure for innovation and fully enabled digital enterprises grows. Our analysis of the survey data and discussions with Chinese CIOs and other business executives reveal four ways that Chinese organizations can raise their technology game and maximize the value and performance of their IT investments.</p>
<h6>Align IT investment with business strategy</h6>



<p>Among Chinese companies, IT has historically been seen as a support function that helps run the day-to-day business by operating, for example, basic domestic enterprise-resource-planning (ERP) and core-banking systems. IT has generally not been viewed as an enabler of strategic growth. Indeed, two-thirds of respon­dents say IT strategy is developed only after the business strategy has been agreed upon. This is partly because of how fast Chinese companies have grown over the past 20 years, prompting them to focus on providing basic IT functionality just to keep the business running smoothly.</p>

<p>Today, however, IT can no longer take a back seat, given the growing maturity and global appetite of Chinese businesses and increasing local competition. Expanding sales overseas, for example, typically requires a company to turn its domestic ERP system into a complex multicountry system that supports both unique local-market requirements and value-chain collaborations across borders. More than three-quarters of CIOs say they want to integrate business and IT strategy better. As one insurance-industry CIO said, “The role of IT is starting to shift from supplier and execution support to shaper of business.”</p>
<p>To get there, organizations must establish much closer collaboration among IT, other functions, and business units at all levels of the enterprise. CIOs should engage early and often with senior leaders to understand how best to direct resources and development efforts to meet their companies’ business objectives. Involving IT in business planning can help organizations achieve greater operational efficiency and promote continued expansion.</p>
<p>Rather than simply funding isolated projects, the business side and IT must agree on a road map to direct spending toward initiatives that support overall growth. Buy-in is also important. Some organizations have found it helpful to implement a chargeback to hold business units responsible for their IT requests. A handful of survey respondents, 5 percent, say they have taken collaboration further by establishing a joint IT and business investment committee. More than half of those surveyed also believe such committees can help ensure effective and efficient IT spending. Indeed, better collaboration between IT and business leaders when setting strategy and allocating investments has helped several leading Chinese companies that are global players success­fully drive their business-transformation programs forward and bring tangible business value.</p>
<h6>Elevate the CIO's role in business transformation</h6>
<p>[[sidebar sidebar]]</p>
<p>Those surveyed agreed that CIOs empowered by their CEO or other senior leaders are in a unique position to drive cross-functional business transformation and should shift their own roles from supply-focused IT providers to business-focused leaders of IT-enabled innovation. In that role they could help spur revenue growth, get products to market faster, and sometimes generate new business models. Nonetheless, few are actively doing so. While about 40 percent of CIOs say they have begun to move beyond traditional, narrow IT roles, less than a third of those in this group currently lead business-transformation programs (Exhibit 2). There is an opportunity for CIOs to elevate their positions and add greater value. The CIO’s role, for instance, is one of the few leadership positions able to look across different business functions and elements such as R&D, marketing, finance, and the supply chain. CIOs that couple technology expertise with an understanding of business processes can offer value-adding insight and solutions. That operational view should allow them to fill a void as well, since unlike Western enterprises, many Chinese companies still do not have a role equivalent to the COO. Alternatively, some organizations appoint a business leader to run the IT organization with the help of IT-savvy managers in order to ensure better alignment and collaboration.</p>

<p>CEO or other senior-level sponsorship is critical to help CIOs manage the inevitable trade-offs between business and IT, for example, when weighing business-unit needs for localized business processes against the benefits of centralizing these processes and thus reducing IT complexity.</p>
<p>Such decisions require changes in business behavior and ways of working, and they cannot be achieved without top-management backing. One successful CIO said, “The reason I can drive business change is that I’m fully support­ed by the CEO.”</p>
<p>In addition, because many CIOs do not have experience in frontline business management, such as business-unit P&L responsibilities, they need to strengthen their knowledge of business strategy and better understand the key elements of their company’s operating model.</p>
<p>Finally, they must earn their spot at the strategy table by bringing value from technology-enabled business solutions. Some leading Chinese companies have already successfully improved business performance by adopting a model where the CIO not only leads IT delivery work but also actively drives business-process trans­formation. This transformation may include supporting international expansion by designing and facilitating a multicountry operating model and establishing a global process template. It may also involve initiating coinnovation with business units in fields such as big-data customer analytics.</p>
<h6>Strengthen IT capabilities for large transformation projects</h6>
<p>Less than half of the CIOs and IT executives surveyed say they are satisfied with their IT team’s capabilities, with the result that many have turned to outsourcing. According to the survey, two to three times as many Chinese companies outsource architecture design as do their global peers. Such heavy reliance on vendors reduces control over projects and may make companies too dependent on external parties, all of which can erode the business team’s confidence in IT.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Instead, Chinese enterprises should consider building and retaining a core IT team with strong capabilities in architecture design, project management, and the analysis of business requirements. But given the shortage of IT talent in China, building that team must be part of a larger effort to develop scalable IT capabilities to deliver value.</p>
<p>To institutionalize those capabilities, companies should improve their training and vendor-management processes and put continuous-improvement opportunities high on their agenda. As one banking CIO said, “We have over 10,000 good-quality IT employees, but we lack a mechanism to make sure they can work together efficiently.” For instance, many Chinese enterprises still lack mature processes for application development and maintenance (ADM) such as demand management and early identification of development defects. Only a quarter of surveyed executives rate their ADM capability as medium to high, but these processes are essential for supporting large transformation projects.</p>
<p>Employee training and development is also key. Chinese organizations should establish formal capability-building programs that focus on cultivating seasoned managers with strong project-management skills. The goal is a virtuous cycle that will raise the status of IT in the organization. The more IT helps solve real business problems, the more respect and support it will receive from the business, and the more inclined its top talent will be to stay and build careers.</p>
<h6>Speed up the adoption of new technology to support business innovation</h6>
<p>Although the majority of companies we surveyed have deployed basic emerging tech­nologies, many are struggling to use them in creating customer-facing innovation. Nearly 90 percent of those surveyed say their companies have basic IT technologies in place, such as core transaction applications and security systems, and 50 to 60 percent have deployed emerging technologies such as mobility devices like smartphones and tablets to support remote operations and collaboration. But they are not yet adopting technologies that require them to develop new business models (Exhibit 3). Less than 15 percent of survey respondents, for instance, report having selectively or mean­ingfully adopted big data–based analytics applications.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a quarter of the surveyed CIOs say they cannot convince senior leaders to allocate sufficient budget and business support to expand teams and applications. As one CIO from a leading Internet player noted, “Technology is available; [the key ques­tion] is how you position yourself to use the technology to build a business model. We have the customer data, but we have not figured out how to use the data yet.”</p>
<p>Pilots are one way to bring business along. To speed up buy-in and results, Chinese organizations can adopt a faster experimental approach that identifies innovative use cases and pilots IT solutions. Taking this approach, one Chinese construction company successfully deployed a custom-made field-crew handset that significantly reduced response time and improved customer satisfaction. In another case, a leading Internet company in China realized 10 million renminbi in revenue after a 12-week, small-scale pilot using big-data analytics. To obtain such quick results, the business team worked hand in hand with the data-analytics team to identify opportunities and develop a prototype for a predictive customer-segmentation model to be used in tailored campaign promotions; the prototype was then tested and refined every one to two weeks.</p>
<p>Chinese organizations invest relatively little in delivering top-line pursuits such as digital-sales channels tapping big-data analytics to improve the customer experience. Chinese CIOs and their teams must act as stewards in building digital enterprises that enable business growth and allow companies to compete successfully against global rivals.</p>

Kaplan and Kreg Nichols]]></dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Public-sector entities,</strong> like many commercial ones, are increasingly undertaking large transformation programs to streamline and improve their core operations. Nowhere is this task more challenging than in the US Department of Defense (DoD), which is committed to transforming its business practices to support faster and more agile operations. This multiyear mission will touch all aspects of the DoD, which has annual net operating costs exceeding $620 billion—including more than $30 billion for technology—2.9 million people, and a supply chain involving 5.2 million items.</p>
<p>[[exhibit exhibit 3]]</p>
<p>
In 2005, the DoD established the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) to help guide transformation efforts throughout the department. The BTA’s responsibilities include deploying enterprise IT systems, publishing the Business Enterprise Architecture, and helping to carry out investment decisions. The agency, for example, oversees programs that manage pay and travel for the armed services, makes proposals to organizations such as the army and the navy (called “components” inside the Pentagon) about how they can transform themselves most effectively, and encourages standardization throughout the department.</p>

Few people have as good a position to reflect upon the DoD’s transformation as David Fisher, the BTA’s first official director. Fisher joined the DoD from Silicon Valley, where as a consultant he helped private-sector companies to implement large enterprise systems. As a special assistant to the deputy undersecretary of defense for financial management, Fisher helped guide an enterprise-level business transformation and served on the team that launched the BTA. McKinsey’s James Kaplan and Kreg Nichols met with him in his office, in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, DC, to discuss the differences between public- and private-sector transformations, as well as what he has learned about managing megaprojects.</p>

<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> Coming from Silicon Valley, how similar do you think the public and private sectors are?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> While the mission may be different, many of the business challenges are the same—for example, tracking supply chains or making certain that people are paid correctly and on time. But the public sector differs in some significant ways. For example, the scale is very different. The size and scope of the Department of Defense are challenging. The best way to think about our size is to take a look at our budget. In all, last year we had gross costs of over $600 billion, more than the sum of the revenues of, say, Wal-Mart, GE, and IBM. It’s enormous, and there’s nothing comparable to it in the private sector.</p>

<p>
Also, our leadership changes regularly—at least every eight years, when presidential administrations turn over, and generally more often. This is a challenge when you consider that huge organizations in the public and private sectors work at transformations for a long time, sometimes up to ten years, before really starting to reap the benefits. Paul Brinkley, the deputy undersecretary of defense for business transformation, reminds us that IBM was undergoing transformation for ten years before the company really started to reap the benefits of overhauling the supply chain, for example. Even in the best situations, transformations take a long time to accomplish. We look to commercial business for an indicative timeline, but you’d have to combine four or five of the Fortune 10 to get the scale of the DoD.</p>

<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> What have you been able to use from your commercial-sector experience?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> My experience working with large companies helped prepare me for this type of role by giving me a willingness to buck the cultural trend and to suggest new ways of doing business. The BTA has been trying to apply the best practices from the commercial world, especially about how we govern and manage IT investments. If there are processes that we can streamline to help programs deliver capabilities faster, without getting bogged down in some of the administrative activities, we try to do that.</p>

<p>
This can be hard to do in a complex, hierarchical environment like the Department of Defense. Fortunately, many people around me, who have more experience within the government culture, have proved to be tremendously valuable at identifying constraints we face in public projects—constraints that just wouldn’t be there in the private sector.</p>
<p>
The department has been trying to modernize the way it does business for a long time, and we still have a long way to go. Every administration tries, and I’m sure we make some progress each time. But on the whole, we’re not where we want to be—or where we need to be. We want to build on the good work that’s been done before us, but we also need to question previous actions that weren’t successful and to offer new solutions.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> What are the goals of your transformation efforts?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Our overall objective is to guide business transformation efforts at the enterprise level of the Department of Defense in order to improve the DoD’s ability to perform its mission. We do that sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. The BTA has a combination of operational and technical roles to play—for example, we manage the systems that handle travel and payroll for about 1.5 million employees of the DoD. But a big part of our role is to identify skill sets that are scattered throughout the DoD and unite them so that its components can work better together. For example, we bring the functional people and the technical people together so that a set of data standards affecting multiple areas can be agreed on.</p>
<p>
Successful coordination among the components doesn’t come from exercising authority but rather from exerting influence. People in the components don’t have to open the door to us, and I’m not empowered to make them open the door. But if I can demonstrate value, they’re going to open the door to me, whether I’m empowered or not. It’s all about adding value. There are certain things that we have authority for, but even in an environment where you have authority, your authority will only carry you so far in the effort to move things forward in a positive direction.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> What are the main challenges in deploying technology to support the transformation?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> We spend about $2 billion each year on IT business transformation, half of it on enterprise resource planning systems throughout the Department of Defense. Much of the work for these ERP systems focuses on deciding what should be centralized, at the DoD enterprise level, and what should be managed by components—the military services, defense agencies, combatant commands, and military health services. As in any large organization, the people at the enterprise level are consumers of information. As long as information in different systems can be aggregated in a standard way, these people can do their jobs. On the other hand, some decision making is distributed, occurring within organizations that make up the DoD. The challenge lies in the gray area. Where is it more effective to have a single system at the center as opposed to multiple versions that adhere to common standards?</p>
<p>
[video Sample Chaptered video]
We have 27 systems in our enterprise portfolio today, and many of these are centralized only because the components did not have the ability to run their own when these systems were implemented years ago. As the capabilities of the components mature, we must ask if there are more efficient and effective ways to complete those transactions while still providing the members of our cross-component community with the information they need to do their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> How do you manage such a large-scale transformation?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Much depends on governance and on discipline in setting and implementing standards. Consider our experience implementing a set of standards for financial data. Initially, the reaction in the field was that this would cost too much to embed in individual IT systems, so we came up with a two-pronged approach.</p>
<p>
In the short term, we agreed to create a bridge system to the components’ legacy accounting systems, to save costs. It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it moved us toward interoperable data at a relatively low cost in a short time frame. Our longer-term challenge involved integrating these standards into various ERP systems. It was critical to get this right, from the beginning. Again, the components’ managers were concerned that this would be expensive and difficult to integrate with their SAP and Oracle systems. So we deployed ERP experts among the components who worked with teams there to identify ways to configure the ERP systems so they could work with standardized data. It’s been very successful.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> How do you keep people motivated and set performance measures?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> When I left the commercial environment, I thought one of the great things about leaving was putting behind me the need to meet quarterly profit-and-loss targets and to deal with the short-term decision making that results from a quarterly focus. But now that I don’t have those constraints, I miss having the motivation to hit quarterly numbers. So you have to look for different kinds of motivators to keep projects on time.</p>
<p>
The people who go into public service are unbelievably passionate about what they do. There is a tangible internal motivation about doing public service that is different from what you find in the commercial marketplace. It’s not something you can necessarily put your finger on, but it’s real. We appreciate that. It’s very important. That said, we have to find ways to measure accountability. In the commercial world, there’s the P&L—you’re held accountable for the numbers. We are always in search of ways to hold people accountable, not least because if you succeed at something, you want to be recognized for it.</p>
<p>
We and the rest of the Defense Department have recently begun to move away from an old tenure-based performance model to a new system—the National Security Personnel System—that is closer to pay for performance. This is the type of system that’s familiar to commercial enterprises, but it’s new to this public environment, so we had to spend some time explaining that the goals had to be objective, measurable, time constrained. It’s been somewhat controversial because not everyone likes this shift. But as a manager, I have found it a positive shift, especially in terms of getting people to think about time. Sometimes, impatience is exactly right because within the public sector, things do tend to run on for a while. We need to build in that internal motivator that makes people ask, what did I get done today?</p>
<p>
In the end, however, while people care about their compensation, just as they should, it’s a small part of what motivates people here. It’s about the contribution to public service. One of the things that rallies the passion of these folks is seeing that they’re making a difference on a national security–related issue that helps the people on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> With such large-scale technology deployments, what have you learned about managing megaprojects?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Many of the things that would portend a successful ERP implementation of small to medium size would portend success for the large programs at the DoD. We’ve looked at the top reasons ERP implementations fail. Many failures come down to governance, change management, requirements management, customization, the skill sets of the people involved, and testing. Those concepts are immutable, regardless of size and scale. Our challenge with these immense projects is that implementation takes such a long time, spanning several generations of IT development. That can be problematic and leave an opportunity for endless analysis and debate.</p>
<p>
It’s also important to clarify what we’re trying to optimize, since one person’s definition of the enterprise may be different from another’s. From my perspective, the enterprise is the Department of Defense. But if I go to the army or navy, they might define the enterprise differently; if they’re trying to optimize the army or navy as opposed to the DoD, we end up with different solutions.</p>
<p>
Let me give you one example of how the BTA’s involvement helped the army reexamine the scope of some of its systems to good effect. The army had three big ERP systems—one that handled finance and two for logistics (a more tactical system for the front end and a more wholesale system for the back end). All three systems were operating fairly independently. Our observation was that, although these independent systems may be optimizing the parts, they were suboptimizing the whole in terms of business processes, management, and the utilization of technology.</p>
[video Sample Video]
<p>
Through some pretty heavy engagements—some well received, others not—we were able to demonstrate that there was a better way to use technology to reduce risks the army would face in the way the systems communicated, reconciled data, and otherwise performed together. We recommended that the army connect the three systems more closely because, for example, each of the logistics transactions was eventually going to be a financial transaction. If you look at things that way from the beginning, it fosters an environment where you look at the business from end to end. The army has now adopted some of those concepts and has a cross-domain governance model. So we got the conversation going and it’s had this positive impact. We weren’t empowered to do any of that by our authority. We were passionate about it, and we were able to convince the army to let us in on the dialogue and help them come to decisions that represented a change for the better.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> Any other big lessons to pass along?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Question every assumption. We often assume that we have to do something in a certain way because it’s the policy or the way we’ve done it before. Question that assumption, and if it doesn’t make sense, find out who owns the policy or who owns the way it was done before. Even laws change. Sometimes the answer is no, and that’s it. But if you have a case that helps everyone to agree that the old way doesn’t make sense and that there’s a better way, a transformational way, of doing things, question the old way.  </p>

We’ve long been interested in work environments that inspire exceptional levels of energy, increase self-confidence, and boost individual productivity. When we ask leaders about the ingredient they think is most often missing for them and for their colleagues—and by implication is most difficult to provide—they almost invariably signal the same thing: a strong sense of meaning. By “meaning,” we and they imply a feeling that what’s happening really matters, that what’s being done has not been done before or that it will make a difference to others.</p><p>
The idea of meaning at work is not new. Indeed, two contributions to <i>McKinsey Quarterly</i><a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote1' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote1' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
See Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer, “<a href='http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_page.aspx?ar=2910'>How leaders kill meaning at work</a>,” mckinseyquarterly.com, January 2012; and Cynthia A. Montgomery, “<a href='http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_page.aspx?ar=2993'>How strategists lead</a>,” mckinseyquarterly.com, July 2012.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> over the past year have highlighted this theme. In one, the authors demonstrate how misguided leaders often kill meaning in avoidable ways. The author of the other suggests that “meaning maker” is a critical role for corporate strategists. In this article, we will show from our research how meaning drives higher workplace productivity and explain what business leaders can do to create meaning.</p><!--roadblock--><h3>Meaning and performance</h3><p>
The mental state that gives rise to great performance—in sports, business, or the arts—has been described in different ways. The psychologist Mihàly Csìkszentmihàlyi studied thousands of subjects, from sculptors to factory workers, and asked them to record their feelings at intervals throughout the working day. Csìkszentmihàlyi came up with a concept we consider helpful. He observed that people fully employing their core capabilities to meet a goal or challenge created what he called “flow.” More important, he found that individuals who frequently experienced it were more productive and derived greater satisfaction from their work than those who didn’t. They set goals for themselves to increase their capabilities, thereby tapping into a seemingly limitless well of energy. And they expressed a willingness to repeat those activities in which they achieved flow even if they were not being paid to do so.</p><p>
Athletes describe the same feeling as being in the zone. Bill Russell, a key player for the Boston Celtics during the period when they won 11 professional-basketball championships in 13 years, put it thus: “When it happened, I could feel my play rise to a new level. . . . It would surround not only me and the other Celtics, but also the players on the other team. . . . At that special level, all sorts of odd things happened. The game would be in the white heat of competition, and yet somehow I wouldn’t feel competitive. . . . I’d be putting out the maximum effort . . . and yet I never felt the pain.”<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote2' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>2</sup></a> <span id='footnote2' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>2.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span></p><p>
Flow sounds great in theory, but few business leaders have mastered the skill of generating it reliably in the workplace. An easy first step is to consider what creates flow in your own work situation—a question we have put directly to more than 5,000 executives during workshops we’ve conducted over the last decade. In this exercise, individuals initially think about their own personal peak performance with a team, when, in other words, they have come closest to the feelings Csìkszentmihàlyi and Russell describe. Then they pinpoint the conditions that made this level of performance possible: what in the team environment was there more or less of than usual?</p><p>
The remarkably consistent answers we’ve received fall into three categories. The first set includes elements such as role clarity, a clear understanding of objectives, and access to the knowledge and resources needed to get the job done. These are what one might term rational elements of a flow experience or, to use a convenient shorthand, its intellectual quotient (IQ). When the IQ of a work environment is low, the energy employees bring to the workplace is misdirected and often conflicting.</p><p>
Another set of answers includes factors related to the quality of the interactions among those involved. Here, respondents often mention a baseline of trust and respect, constructive conflict, a sense of humor, a general feeling that “we’re in this together,” and the corresponding ability to collaborate effectively. These create an emotionally safe environment to pursue challenging goals or, to borrow from the writings of Daniel Goleman and others, an environment with a high emotional quotient (EQ). When the EQ of a workplace is lacking, employee energy dissipates in the form of office politics, ego management, and passive-aggressive avoidance of tough issues.</p><p>
While IQ and EQ are absolutely necessary to create the conditions for peak performance, they are far from sufficient. The longest list of words we have compiled from executives’ answers to our peak-performance question over the last ten years has little to do with either of these categories. This third one describes the peak-performance experience as involving high stakes; excitement; a challenge; and something that the individual feels matters, will make a difference, and hasn’t been done before. We describe this third category as the meaning quotient (MQ) of work. When a business environment’s MQ is low, employees put less energy into their work and see it as “just a job” that gives them little more than a paycheck.</p><p>
The opportunity cost of the missing meaning is enormous. When we ask executives during the peak-performance exercise how much more productive they were at their peak than they were on average, for example, we get a range of answers, but the most common at senior levels is an increase of five times. Most report that they and their employees are in the zone at work less than 10 percent of the time, though some claim to experience these feelings as much as 50 percent of it. If employees working in a high-IQ, high-EQ, and high-MQ environment are five times more productive at their peak than they are on average, consider what even a relatively modest 20-percentage-point increase in peak time would yield in overall workplace productivity—it would almost double.</p><p>
What’s more, when we ask executives to locate the bottlenecks to peak performance in their organizations, more than 90 percent choose MQ-related issues. They point out that much of the IQ tool kit is readily observable and central to what’s taught in business schools. The EQ tool kit, while “softer,” is now relatively well understood following Goleman’s popularization of the concept in the mid-1990s. The MQ tool kit is different.</p><h3>What to do differently</h3><p>
Business leaders, we know from other sources, are striving hard to find the missing MQ ingredients so they can improve motivation and workforce productivity. Late last year, for example, a survey (conducted by The Conference Board and McKinsey) of more than 500 US-based HR executives identified employee engagement as one of the top five critical human-capital priorities facing organizations.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote3' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>3</sup></a> <span id='footnote3' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>3.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

Management thinkers are also on the case. Gary Hamel urges modern managers to see themselves as “entrepreneurs of meaning.” In <i>The Progress Principle</i>, Harvard Business School professor Teresa Amabile and her coauthor Steve Kramer present rigorous field research highlighting the enormous benefits that a sense of forward momentum can have for employees’ “inner work life.”<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote4' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>4</sup></a> <span id='footnote4' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>4.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

In our experience, though, there’s often a disconnect between the desire of practitioners to create meaning in the workplace, the good ideas emerging from cutting-edge research, and the number of specific, practical, and reliable tools that leaders know how to use. Often, platitudes about communication, quality feedback, job flexibility, and empowerment are used as substitutes for such tools. Much of this amounts to little more than advice about how to be a good manager. Inspirational visions, along the lines of Walt Disney’s “make people happy” or Google’s “organize the world’s information,” have little relevance if you produce ball bearings or garage doors.</p><p>
In McKinsey’s research, we’ve uncovered a set of specific, actionable techniques underpinned both by experience and a significant body of social-science work. The full tool kit can be found in <i>Beyond Performance: How Great Organizations Build Ultimate Competitive Advantage</i>.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote6' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>6</sup></a> <span id='footnote6' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>6.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
Scott Keller and Colin Price, <i>Beyond Performance: How Great Organizations Build Ultimate Competitive Advantage</i>, first edition, Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2011.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> The three examples described here are not only among the most counterintuitive (and therefore the most often overlooked) but also the most powerful.</p><h3 class="sm black">Strategy #1: Tell five stories at once</h3><p>We typically see organizational leaders tell two types of stories to inspire their teams. The first, the turnaround story, runs along the lines of “We’re performing below industry standard and must change dramatically to survive—incremental change is not sufficient to attract investors to our underperforming company.” The second, the good-to-great story, goes something like this: “We are capable of far more, given our assets, market position, skills, and loyal staff, and can become the undisputed leader in our industry for the foreseeable future.”</p><p>
The problem with both approaches is that the story centers on the company, and that will inspire some but by no means all employees. Our research shows that four other sources give individuals a sense of meaning, including their ability to have an impact on</p><ul class="leftContentUL"><li><p>society—for example, making a better society, building the community, or stewarding resources</p></li><li><p>the customer—for instance, making life easier and providing a superior service or product</p></li><li><p>the working team—for instance, a sense of belonging, a caring environment, or working together efficiently and effectively</p></li><li><p>themselves—examples include personal development, a higher paycheck or bonus, and a sense of empowerment</p></li></ul><p>
Surveys of hundreds of thousands of employees show that the split in most companies—regardless of management level, industry sector, or geography (developed or developing economies)—is roughly equal. It appears that these five sources are a universal human phenomenon.</p><p>
The implication for leaders seeking to create high-MQ environments is that a turnaround or a good-to-great story will strike a motivational chord with only 20 percent of the workforce. The same goes for a “change the world” vision like those of Disney and Google or appeals to individuals on a personal level. The way to unleash MQ-related organizational energy is to tell all five stories at once.</p><p>
A recent cost-reduction program at a large US financial-services company began with a rational-change story focused on the facts: expenses were growing faster than revenues. Three months into the program, it was clear that employee resistance was stymieing progress. The management team therefore worked together to recast the story to include elements related to society (more affordable housing), customers (increased simplicity and flexibility, fewer errors, more competitive prices), working teams (less duplication, more delegation, increased accountability, a faster pace), and individuals (bigger and more attractive jobs, a once-in-a-career opportunity to build turnaround skills, a great opportunity to “make your own” institution). The program was still <i>what</i> it was—a cost-reduction program—but the reasons it mattered were cast in far more meaningful terms.</p><p>
Within a month, the share of employees reporting that they were motivated to drive the change program forward jumped to 57 percent, from 35 percent, according to the company’s employee-morale pulse surveys. The program went on to exceed initial expectations, raising efficiency by 10 percent in the first year.</p><h3 class="sm black">Strategy #2: Let employees ‘write their own lottery ticket’</h3><p>The first strategy gives specific and practical guidance about how to <i>tell</i> the story. Yet the best meaning makers spend more time <i>asking</i> than telling.</p><p>
In one of Daniel Kahneman’s famous experiments, researchers ran a lottery with a twist. Half of the participants were randomly assigned a lottery ticket. The remaining half were given a blank piece of paper and asked to write down any number they pleased. Just before drawing the winning number, the researchers offered to buy back the tickets from their holders. The question they wanted to answer was how much more would you have to pay people who “wrote their own number” than people who received a number randomly. The rational answer should be no difference at all, since a lottery is pure chance, and therefore every ticket number, chosen or assigned, has the same odds of winning. A completely rational actor might even want to pay less for a freely chosen number, given the possibility of duplicate ones. The actual answer? Regardless of geography or demographics, researchers found they had to pay at least five times more to those who chose their own number.</p><p>
This result reveals a truth about human nature: when we choose for ourselves, we are far more committed to the outcome—by a factor of at least five to one.</p><p>
In business, of course, leaders can’t just let everyone decide their own direction. But they can still apply the lessons of the lottery-ticket experiment. The head of financial services at one global bank we know first wrote down his change story, shared it with his team for feedback, and then in effect asked all individual team members to write their own lottery ticket: what change story, in each of the businesses, supported the wider message? His team members in turn wrote change stories, shared them with <i>their</i> teams, and the process continued all the way to the front line. Although this method took far longer than the traditional road-show approach, the return on commitment to the program was considered well worth the investment and an important reason the bank achieved roughly two times its revenue-per-banker-improvement targets.</p><p>
Likewise, when Neville Isdell took charge at Coca-Cola, in 2004, he cocreated a turnaround strategy by bringing together his top 150 employees for three multiday “real work” sessions. The process was then cascaded further down into the organization, at small working meetings where participants could in effect write their own lottery ticket about the implications for their particular parts of the business. With hindsight, this process of creating and interactively cascading what became known as The Manifesto for Growth is seen as a pivotal intervention in a two-year turnaround in which the group stopped destroying shareholder value and generated returns of 20 percent, driven by volume increases equivalent to selling an extra 105 million bottles of Coke a day. In this period, staff turnover fell by 25 percent, and the company reported what external researchers called unprecedented increases in employee engagement for an organization of this size.</p><p>
Leaders who need to give their employees more of a sense of direction can still leverage the lottery-ticket insight by augmenting their telling of the story with asking about the story. David Farr, chairman and CEO of Emerson Electric, for example, is known for asking virtually everyone he encounters in the organization four questions: (1) how do you make a difference? (testing for alignment with the company’s direction); (2) what improvement idea are you working on? (emphasizing continuous improvement); (3) when did you last get coaching from your boss? (emphasizing the importance of people development); and (4) who is the enemy? (emphasizing the importance of “One Emerson” and no silos, as well as directing the staff’s energy toward the external threat). The motivational effect of this approach has been widely noted by Emerson employees.</p><h3 class="sm black">Strategy #3: Use small, unexpected rewards to motivate</h3><p>US author Upton Sinclair once wrote, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” The flip side, however, isn’t true. When business objectives are linked to compensation, the motivation to drive for results is rarely enhanced meaningfully.</p><p>
The reason is as practical as psychological. Most annual-compensation plans of executives are so full of key performance indicators that the weighting of any one objective becomes largely meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Furthermore, most compensation plans typically emphasize financial metrics whose results depend on myriad variables, many beyond individual control. On top of that, most companies don’t have deep enough pockets to make compensation a significant driver of MQ in the workplace.</p><p>
Leaders of organizations that successfully instill meaning understand the power of other methods. Terry Burnham and Jay Phelan’s book, <i>Mean Genes</i>,<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote7' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>7</sup></a> <span id='footnote7' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>7.</span><span class='footnote-text'> Terry Burnham and Jay Phelan, <i>Mean Genes: From Sex to Money to Food: Taming Our Primal Instincts</i>, first edition, New York, NY: Perseus Publishing, 2000. 
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> describes an experiment in which 50 percent of a group of people using a photocopier found a dime in the coin-return slot. When all were asked to rate their satisfaction level, those who got the dime scored an average of 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 7, while those who didn’t scored just 5.6. The lesson here is that when we aren’t expecting a reward, even a small one can have a disproportionate effect on our state of mind. And that’s also true of employees in the workplace.</p><p>
At ANZ Bank, John McFarlane gave all employees a bottle of champagne for Christmas, with a card thanking them for their work on a major change program. The CEO of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf, marked the first anniversary of its change program by sending out personal thank-you notes to all the employees who had been involved, with specific messages related to the impact of their individual work. Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, sends the spouses of her top team handwritten thank-you letters. After seeing the impact of her own success on her mother during a visit to India, she began sending letters to the parents of her top team, too.</p><p>
Some managers might dismiss these as token gestures—but employees often tell us that the resulting boost in motivation and in connection to the leader and the company can last for months if not years. As Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores, put it, “Nothing else can quite substitute for a few well-chosen, well-timed, sincere words of praise. They’re absolutely free—and worth a fortune.”</p><div class="articleBreak"></div><p>Of the three Qs that characterize a workplace likely to generate flow and inspire peak performance, we frequently hear from business leaders that MQ is the hardest to get right. Given the size of the prize for injecting meaning into people’s work lives, taking the time to implement strategies of the kind described here is surely among the most important investments a leader can make.<br /></p><div class="about-authors"><h3 class="sm black">About the authors</h3><p><b>Susie Cranston</b> is a senior expert in McKinsey’s San Francisco office, and <b>Scott Keller</b> is a director in the Southern California office.</p></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Managing when vendor and supplier risk becomes your own</title><description>Financial institutions are being held accountable for the actions of their suppliers.

<strong>The rising tide</strong> of regulatory scrutiny stemming from the global financial crisis has now reached beyond banks, to the companies that supply them. Under the broad notion that activities can be outsourced, but responsibility can’t, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and other regulators are holding financial institutions responsible not only for their own actions but also for those of their vendors and suppliers. In the past year, for example, American Express, Capital One, and Discover Bank have paid a total of more than $530 million to settle complaints of deceptive selling and predatory behavior by their third-party suppliers.</p>
<p>
This new regulatory thrust poses a big challenge for financial institutions because some of them have a limited perspective on their suppliers’ interactions with customers. The largest banks and credit-card companies can have close to 50,000 suppliers. They are quite careful about some of these relationships and often have teams to manage large and midsize suppliers. Of course, many vendors provide paper, computers, and other innocuous goods and services. But a significant number of vendor relationships are not closely managed, and some carry hidden risks. A company that molds and prints credit cards, for example, is entrusted with customer data, and that poses any number of privacy and security risks.</p>
<p>
At many institutions, vendor-management programs have focused predominantly on risks to the bank and the financial system—specifically, on business continuity, financial strength, and credit risk. With the scope of regulatory oversight broadening to include the consumer, many firms are underprepared. But since financial institutions must bear the responsibility for their suppliers’ misdeeds, they must improve the way they manage these relationships.</p>
<p>
In response to the changes, financial firms are looking for new solutions to identify and manage third-party risk. A number of leading banks and credit-card companies are developing and embracing best practices. Our research and experience have helped us develop a comprehensive approach to managing third-party risk. It consists of six essential steps, some of which can be executed in parallel.</p>
<h3>1. A comprehensive inventory of third parties</h3>
<p>
Regulators now expect institutions to know their third parties, how each of them interacts with consumers, and what activities it performs. Many firms do not have this information readily available. Supplier databases can be incomplete, and some of the most sensitive risks can reside in relationships that are not found in them. Cobranded partnerships, joint ventures, sponsorships, and similar relationships can account for up to 80 percent of the spending that some business units assign to suppliers. But these relationships are often managed in ways that emphasize commercial goals, with only a secondary focus on risk. What’s more, in some firms individual business units have different ways of tracking their suppliers, making it difficult to compare and collate them across an entire organization.</p>
<p>
In our experience, an effective database of third parties includes all of them—that is, any noncustomer entity with which a financial institution has a business relationship. An enterprise-wide survey is a good way to get started.</p>
<h3>2. A comprehensive catalog of third-party risks</h3>
<p>
To monitor consumer risk successfully, firms must develop a comprehensive catalog of these risks, also known as breakpoints, which form the basis for scorecards, audit routines, and other monitoring activities. Consider one breakpoint for a third-party call center: if there is a risk that agents will misrepresent product information to customers, a bank may investigate this specific problem by having calls monitored and may request regular reports on their quality and on customer-escalation metrics (exhibit). Identifying the relevant breakpoints for each category of suppliers and determining the relative weight and importance of every breakpoint can be challenging. Building a master register of breakpoints and their associated risk weights for all of these categories can help. Although broadly relevant to most firms, the master register can be adapted to the particular circumstances of an individual organization and its unique third-party relationships. This process is essential, as it helps the firm identify the true drivers of its risks and guides its mitigation program.</p>

<h3>3. A risk-based segmentation</h3>
<p>
Once a firm has a complete inventory of third-party suppliers and the risks they pose to customers, it can segment its suppliers by risk level. Even a simple system of high-, medium-, and low-risk categories can be useful. We have observed that most leading institutions have 200 to 300 high-risk relationships at a time, irrespective of the total number of third parties with which they contract. An effective segmentation can help a firm determine how to utilize its resources strategically. It may, for example, conduct additional due diligence on high-risk relationships and automate regular reviews of low-risk suppliers.</p>
<p>
In our experience, firms typically use either of two approaches to segment third-party suppliers. Companies that follow the score-based approach conduct due diligence across all dimensions and use the results to develop a composite risk score. Although very thorough, this approach can be onerous and resource intensive for many organizations. Using the rules-based approach, a firm identifies specific rules or criteria for each segment and thereby streamlines the process of assigning suppliers to risk categories. In fact, this approach is about 40 to 60 percent faster than the score-based one. Given the importance of an approach to segmentation, leading institutions tend to invest heavily in designing it. Typically, they appoint a core team of risk experts to lead the design, the fine-tuning, and the implementation.</p>
<h3>4. A rules-based due-diligence test</h3>
<p>
Today, firms are expected to expand their due-diligence efforts beyond the traditional assessments for supplier, operational, and IT-security risks. Regulators are increasingly sensitive to strategic and reputational risks that third parties can create for customers. Traditional approaches align specific due-diligence activities with the risk category identified by the risk-based segmentation; a supplier in the high-risk category is subject to all due-diligence investigations. Like the score-based segmentation approach, this one can be overly onerous and resource intensive. Here too the rules-based approach can be a better answer because it triggers an appropriate set of due-diligence activities for the risks identified. For example, even if a third party is deemed to pose a high risk, an information-security or data-privacy screening is unnecessary if the supplier does not hold information that personally identifies customers. We estimate that the rules-based approach can cut employee time by close to 40 percent.   </p>
<h3>5. A disciplined governance and escalation process</h3>
<p>
Organizational alignment is particularly important when decision-making rights are spread across a range of businesses and functions, such as procurement, compliance, and operational-risk management. By proactively establishing governance structures and processes to address misalignments, institutions can resolve challenges quickly.</p>
<p>
Governance can be centralized or decentralized; both models (and some hybrids) can be successful. In the centralized model, most major risk decisions reside within a single group, such as procurement or shared services. While the centralized model identifies a clear and accountable “owner,” it can sometimes lead to tension between the business unit that has a working relationship with a third party and the centralized body accountable for risk assessments.</p>
<p>
In the decentralized model, the business unit that owns the relationship also manages the risk. This arrangement can sometimes result in a duplication of resources: several business units may, for example, assess a major third-party supplier for similar contracts. In some cases, the application and alignment of risk standards can be inconsistent in a decentralized model: the groups managing, say, procurement and operational risk could have different perspectives. A hybrid approach, carefully tailored to the organizational context, can help mitigate challenges associated with the two models as long as risk ownership is clear.</p>
<p>
An escalation framework is critical to resolve issues—such as requests for exceptions and the resolution of third-party breaches—that exceed the decision-making limits set out in the governance structure. While most organizations have an operational-risk management group, its governance model and mandate might not be sufficient to address the additional volume of third-party issues. In our experience, leading financial institutions often choose to assign new responsibilities to standing committees rather than create new ones to support third-party escalations. Each organization must find an appropriate approach given its appetite for risk and its culture.</p>
<h3>6. An integrated management-reporting and workflow process and tools</h3>
<p>
Clear, actionable management reports and well-designed workflow systems are essential for accountability across the business units, compliance, and audit. To work well, these tools must track and monitor the relevant data. More important, they must aid the workflow within and across business units and give managers a clear picture of real-time risk, with actionable recommendations. In our experience, most organizations currently have tools that address one or two of these functional needs, but to our knowledge none has a single tool that performs all three.</p>
<p>
Building a new third-party risk application from scratch is a big undertaking; so too is enhancing a current risk tool to perform new functions. Some firms have turned to off-the-shelf workflow- and risk-management tools that can easily be customized to an organization’s specific needs.</p>

Risks from vendors and suppliers pose a significant challenge to financial institutions. A systematic approach to managing those risks can lower costs and help banks present a coherent approach to all key stakeholders, including regulators.</p>

Poverty is falling, and around 90 million of its households have joined the world’s consuming classes—an increase of 31 million in just over a decade. But a new McKinsey Global Institute report, <em>Africa at work: Job creation and inclusive growth</em>, shows that the continent must create wage-paying jobs more quickly to sustain these successes and ensure that growth benefits the majority of its people. </p>
<p>Despite the creation of 37 million new and stable wage-paying jobs over the past decade, only 28 percent of Africa’s labor force holds such positions. Instead, some 63 percent of the total labor force engages in some form of self-employment or “vulnerable” employment, such as subsistence farming or urban street hawking. If the trends of the past decade continue, Africa will create 54 million new, stable wage-paying jobs over the next ten years—but this will not be enough to absorb the 122 million new entrants into the labor force expected over the same period. However, by implementing a five-part strategy to accelerate the pace of job creation, we estimate that Africa could add as many as 72 million new wage-paying jobs over the next decade, raising the wage-earning share of the labor force to 36 percent. </p>

<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>1. Identify one or more labor-intensive subsectors in which an African country has a global competitive advantage or could fill strong domestic demand.</span> Lesotho, for example, capitalized on the African Growth and Opportunity Act (2000), granting some African exports duty-free access to US markets. A landlocked nation surrounded entirely by South Africa, Lesotho developed industrial zones for the apparel industry and built rail links between them, offered incentives to foreign investors, and simplified the regulation of the sector. Today, Lesotho’s apparel exports to the United States are almost 100 times as large as South Africa’s on a per capita basis, and the sector is the single largest creator of jobs, employing about 40,000 people in 2008 in a country of just two million. </h3></span>
<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>2. Improve access to finance in target sectors. Cape Verde, for instance, encouraged foreign direct investment to ease financial constraints on its tourism sector.</span> To capitalize on the country’s beautiful beaches, it offered investors a five-year tax holiday, exemption from import duties, and unrestricted expatriation of profits. Revenues generated by foreign tourism increased from $23 million in 1999 to $542 million in 2008, and the sector now employs 21 percent of Cape Verde’s workforce. </h3></span>
<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>3. Build a suitable infrastructure. Countries that remove infrastructure constraints in target subsectors, particularly in export-oriented industries, can reap sizable benefits.</span> Mali’s exports of mangoes to the European Union, for example, grew sixfold between 2003 and 2008 after a concerted public–private program helped the country build integrated road, rail, and other infrastructure necessary to access export markets. These moves cut the transit time for shipments in half. </h3></span>
<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>4. Cut unnecessary regulations. Removing needless red tape in certain sectors is also important.</span> In Rwanda, for instance, streamlining the procedures needed to open a business dramatically increased the number of new companies, from only 700 a year before the reform to 3,000 a year today. </h3></span>
<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>5. Develop skills in target sectors. Around 40 percent of African workers now have at least some secondary education, and that share will rise to 48 percent by 2020.</span> Few employers in our survey of businesses in Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa reported that a lack of skilled workers was a top barrier to growth. Still, Africa’s educational attainment lags behind that of other regions, and the continent would undoubtedly benefit from continued improvement. Two things are of particular importance: work readiness among school graduates and, in some countries, specific vocational skills. </h3></span>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can Africa continue to grow?Upated</title><description>A panel of regional business leaders discusses its prospects.</description><link>http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/africa/copy_of_can_africa_continue_to_grow</link><guid>http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/africa/copy_of_can_africa_continue_to_grow</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2013 11:55:21 GMT</pubDate><ID>5525cbd6-93af-45bf-8f79-d9e6918640b1</ID><category>Africa</category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mckinsey]]></dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gross corruption,</strong> constant wars, and irrational economics long made Africa a poor, troubled continent where natural-resource companies were almost the only multinationals that dared or cared to do business. But in the 1990s, the picture improved. The wars started subsiding. Many governments balanced their budgets and created a better, safer environment for companies, both foreign and domestic. And the African consumer began to stir. Now 80 million households earn at least the equivalent of $5,000 annually, the point where discretionary spending commences—an increase of 80 percent in eight years. Meanwhile, the continent’s GDP has been rising steadily, at around 5 percent a year, for the past decade, reaching $1.6 trillion in 2008. Last year, Africa was one of just two regions (the other was Asia) where GDP rose. </p>

Indeed, Japanese companies are making international forays, albeit quietly: it is a little-reported fact that the number of outbound M&A deals in Japan has been on an upward trajectory in recent years. If the trend continues, Japanese cross-border M&A activity will soon surpass its 1990 peak. </p><p>
Deal levels would be even higher if Japanese companies were not haunted by past M&A failures. Pitfalls abound along the road to international M&A, and although some of them are now well-known and thus studiously circumvented, others—particularly those having to do with fundamental differences in business and management culture—seem almost impossible for Japanese companies to avoid. Retaining foreign talent presents a particular challenge. </p><p>
To gain insights into how Japanese companies should manage international acquisitions, we interviewed non-Japanese executives whose companies have been acquired by Japanese companies in large cross-border M&A deals within the past decade. We also conducted in-depth outside-in analyses on a handful of deals in which Japanese companies—such as Hitachi Construction Machinery, Suzuki Motors, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, and Toshiba—were able to boost international sales through cross-border M&A.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote1' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote1' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
We focused on deals in which the acquirer sought partial integration (neither full autonomy for the subsidiary nor a complete merger) since this is a common model applied by Japanese companies, many of which do not have the confidence to fully integrate an overseas entity.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span></p><p>
Our findings indicate that there is no silver-bullet approach to capturing the greatest value from an international acquisition. Companies have had success using a variety of approaches, each tailored to the acquirer’s strategic intentions, its unique characteristics, and the dynamics of the industry. Although a company’s particular industry, context, and objectives should dictate the specific tactics it uses, the approaches we studied can give acquirers a starting point to consider—whether that starting point entails focusing on one such tactic or emulating all of them. </p><!--roadblock--><h3>Perspectives of the acquired</h3><p>
Most Japanese executives who have played the global M&A game are familiar with the most common obstacles: disagreement between the acquirer and the acquired over how much value ought to be captured immediately after the deal closes or the positioning of the new subsidiary within the parent company, assumptions by Japanese leaders that what works for their company must also work elsewhere, inattention to the acquired company’s employees, and a lack of postacquisition-management leadership and skills. </p><p>
What may be less familiar—and even surprising—to them are the observations of executives at US and European companies that have been acquired by Japanese companies. Interviews with executives from six such companies of various sizes (from $200 million to $1 billion in value) indicate a number of stumbling blocks. The first four, in particular, are detrimental to talent retention; they are the main reasons that non-Japanese executives do not stay long at such companies. </p><p><strong>A hands-off approach.</strong> Although Japanese executives may think the acquired company would prefer to be left alone—and although the parent company’s restraint may at first appear admirable and wise—many foreign executives come to feel that this is the wrong approach. One major benefit of being acquired, they say, should be that the subsidiary can fully leverage the capabilities of its parent company. Foreign executives want the acquirer to engage with its new subsidiary and jointly tackle issues as they arise. </p><p><strong>An ambiguous power structure.</strong> Non-Japanese executives have difficulty determining where the true power lies within a Japanese organization. For example, the deal executive in an M&A situation could have a lofty title (such as senior managing director). The target company might therefore focus on building a relationship with this person, continue to interact with him after the acquisition, and belatedly discover that he actually has no direct reports and no influence over day- to-day business. In one case, the deal executive was kept on staff only because he was a favorite of the former CEO. </p><p><strong>The tyranny of the middle.</strong> Our interviewees said that middle managers at the parent company can be destructive forces: they derive power from their proximity to the Japanese CEO and try to control information. A common example: if the acquired company requests additional capital investment for growth, middle managers may choose not to raise this request to the CEO. When the leaders of the acquired company follow up with the CEO a few months later, they learn that the CEO was never informed of the request. Incidents such as this can cause middle management to lose the respect of line leaders at the acquired company. </p><p><strong>The glass ceiling for foreigners.</strong> Japanese companies often have an insular culture. The general assumption is that a foreigner can rise only so high in the organization. Foreign executives thus consider leaving not because of unsatisfactory compensation but because they feel their careers are unfairly capped. </p><p><strong>Detail orientation.</strong> American and European executives have difficulty understanding Japanese attention to detail. A Japanese company’s due-diligence checklist, for example, is typically three times longer than that of an acquisition-savvy Western company, in part due to Japanese companies’ risk aversion. In a postacquisition setting, a Japanese company would want to understand, for instance, the discrepancy between a sales forecast and actual sales. It could very well decide to investigate assumptions made a year ago, whereas a Western company would care only about the actual sales figure and how to improve it. </p><p><strong>Poor postacquisition planning.</strong> Attention to detail notwithstanding, Japanese companies tend to be laissez-faire about what happens immediately after a deal closes. They do not see value in creating a concrete architecture in the interim to ensure a successful transition. Foreign executives often lament that transition governance and interim processes for decision making, resource allocation, and escalation of business-critical issues are insufficiently discussed. </p><p><strong>Sudden metamorphosis from friendly partner to distant boss.</strong> Our interviewees reported several experiences in which the initial integration phase was friendly and collaborative, then abruptly morphed into an intense discussion about steep cost reduction. Although this happens in non-Japanese settings as well, it is particularly pronounced in Japanese M&A because Japanese buyers can be extremely polite—to a point that foreigners sometimes find misleading. In one case, even though the acquirer had already decided to eliminate the target company’s research department, executives still made multiple visits to the target’s research sites to keep up appearances. When employees at the target company learned that the decision was made months ago, their trust in the parent company crumbled. </p><h3>Four approaches</h3><p>
To find out how Japanese companies have addressed one or more of these pitfalls, we examined the approach of the very small number of companies—14, to be exact—that completed at least five acquisitions during the past decade and generate more than half their revenues from overseas markets. In each of the deals we examined, the acquirer used a different postacquisition approach depending on the focus of the change program (exhibit). The approaches are not mutually exclusive. A company can emulate elements from all of them, depending on its particular industry, context, and objectives. </p>

    <h3 class="sm black">Establishing mentorship or exchange programs to build leadership talent</h3><p>For acquirers whose main objectives include leadership development, one tactic involves pairing high-potential managers from the acquired company with an executive from the parent company as a coach and mentor. This helps build alignment between the acquirer and the acquired. The frequent and direct communication between leaders at both entities—without having to go through middle management—also allows for tighter coordination. </p><p>
When in 2002 Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor acquired a majority stake of Indian company Maruti Udyog, Suzuki engineered change at the top. It appointed a Suzuki executive as president and CEO of Maruti and took over 6 of the 11 board seats. But it also promoted four high-potential Maruti leaders—in sales, marketing, R&D, and administration—to corporate-officer roles and assigned each a functional executive from Suzuki as a mentor. The pairs were held jointly accountable for formulating new strategies. If postacquisition performance is any indication, the mentorship program has worked: Maruti’s sales have quadrupled, and profits are up 17 times from 2002 levels. </p><p>
Another promising tactic is two-way dispatch of executives (from acquirer to target and vice versa). When Takeda acquired US pharmaceutical company Millennium in 2008, it engineered an exchange of personnel to facilitate mutual understanding of corporate cultures. It invited Millennium’s CEO to join Takeda’s management team. Researchers from both companies traveled between Japan and the United States to strengthen their research capabilities. In 2011, Takeda transferred several Millennium researchers to its new research center in Japan. And Takeda recently named Millennium’s head of strategy—a Westerner—as head of business development for Takeda, showing the company’s openness to high-potential leaders from its subsidiary. Thanks to Millennium, which has been put in charge of all oncology efforts at Takeda, the company is now preparing to begin trials of three or four cancer-drug candidates per year—a significant increase from historical levels. </p><p>
These talent-development programs signal to foreign executives that the parent company is willing to invest in their professional advancement, giving them confidence that they can break through the perceived glass ceiling. </p><h3 class="sm black">Creating a special coordination unit at the division level</h3><p>
Another model entails the creation of a dedicated coordination office or unit to manage the integration. Depending on the company’s objective, the unit can be large or small. A large coordination office may make sense if there is a strong appetite for capturing value from cost synergies (by streamlining operations) and revenue synergies (by launching new initiatives that leverage both companies’ strengths). If the goal is intervention in one or two functions, a smaller, SWAT-type team may be more apt. In either case, the model helps avoid a leadership gap in postacquisition management. With a dedicated team, there is no question as to who is leading the integration effort. Toshiba acquired US-based Westinghouse Electric in 2006 to raise Toshiba’s global presence in nuclear generation. Toshiba sought to influence Westinghouse while also allowing it a degree of autonomy—which was critical, since the two companies had different types of nuclear technology. Toshiba set up two coordination offices: one within Westinghouse, whose members were drawn from Toshiba and its strategic partners Shaw Group and IHI (both of which had minority stakes in Westinghouse), and another within Toshiba. The offices worked together on strategy development and implementation. Three years later, Toshiba had record orders, including its first US orders for two large-scale projects. </p><p>
Hitachi Construction Machinery took a slightly different tack when it acquired a majority stake in Indian construction-equipment manufacturer Telcon, a joint venture with Tata Motors, in 2010. With the goal of increasing the quality of Telcon’s products, Hitachi dispatched seven Hitachi experts to the Telcon functions that needed fundamental change, such as quality assurance and product design. This specialist team, which was expanded in 2010, had full authority to direct Telcon’s performance-improvement efforts and created plans to optimize manufacturing processes, support services, and employee training. By creating a dedicated team, a company can begin to build internal skills that will prove useful in subsequent acquisitions. In the best cases, the individuals chosen for the coordination office are high-potential executives with excellent communication skills and business savvy. </p><h3 class="sm black">Developing local trainers as change agents</h3><p>In the third model, the front line is the focus of change. Employees from the foreign company are brought to Japan for “train the trainer” sessions that are more than a means of technology transfer— they also become opportunities to promote Japanese corporate values and management philosophy. These sessions help create a sense of belonging among the acquired employees that can, in turn, lead to greater motivation and higher employee-retention rates. </p><p>
When a Japanese manufacturer acquired a Southeast Asian company in 2006, it became the industry’s second-largest player. The acquirer was deliberate in how it chose to transfer its technology to its new subsidiary: it abandoned its traditional system of sending senior Japanese engineers to overseas subsidiaries to serve as trainers. Instead, select employees from the acquired company came to Japan for training, then returned to their home countries to train local employees. Approximately 700 non-Japanese employees have now undergone training in Japan; 60 of them have gone on to further study and been designated expert trainers. Although the Japanese corporation suffered along with the rest of the industry during the economic crisis, the combined company was recently able to beat the market leader for a high-profile contract—an achievement in which the new subsidiary played a critical role. </p><p>
By choosing not to dispatch its own employees but rather to bring in employees from the acquired company, Japanese companies can create room for “translation”: the change agents at the new subsidiary come to understand the corporate strategy and the vision for the integrated entity, and they develop a greater understanding of and appreciation for the technical advantages that each company offers. These change agents become effective champions of Japanese techniques and practices. </p><h3 class="sm black">Implementing company-wide culture-infusion programs</h3><p>
To infuse Japanese business culture into an acquired company, acquirers can launch initiatives that differ completely from those preceding them and ensure frequent communication on all fronts (for example, through employee newsletters or town halls). The most effective initiatives appear to be informal mechanisms that model Japanese norms while also bridging the divide between management and the front line. Company-wide programs, implemented correctly, can help motivate and retain target-company employees.</p><p>Suzuki, for instance, gave all Maruti employees sufficient exposure to Suzuki’s unique way of doing things. It promoted an open corporate culture, which was foreign and jarring in the Indian context. Top management and employees eat in the same cafeteria. Everyone, from the CEO to the factory worker, wears the same uniform to work. All employees—again, including the CEO—participate in morning exercise routines. (Although several Japanese companies hold dear the ritual of morning exercises, no others, to our knowledge, have introduced it at a non-Japanese subsidiary.)</p><div class="articleBreak"></div><p>These case examples should give Japanese executives the confidence to venture beyond Japan’s borders. Our findings indicate that there are a variety of promising approaches to postacquisition management and that leaders of Japanese companies must develop their own winning approach—sometimes through trial and error and constant refinement. Their first step should be to compile a list of acquisition targets that make sense given their strategic intentions. They should then come up with guiding principles and a blueprint for a postacquisition-management approach, tailored to their company’s strengths and the key value drivers of the industry. Japanese companies can—and indeed, if they want to grow, must—go global.<br /></p><div class="about-authors"><h3 class="sm black">About the authors</h3><p><b>Keiko Honda</b> is a director in McKinsey’s Tokyo office, where <b>Keith Lostaglio</b> and <b>Genki Oka</b> are partners.</p></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A CEO’s guide to innovation in China in master</title><description>Dynamic domestic players and focused multinationals are helping China churn out a growing number of innovative products and services.

Other developments—such as advances by local companies in domestically oriented consumer electronics, instant messaging, and online gaming—may well be escaping the notice of executives who aren’t on the ground in China.</p>
<p>As innovation gains steam there, the stakes are rising for domestic and multinational companies alike. Prowess in innovation will not only become an increasingly important differentiator inside China but should also yield ideas and products that become serious competitors on the international stage.</p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p>Chinese companies and multinationals bring different strengths and weaknesses to this competition. The Chinese have traditionally had a bias toward innovation through commercialization—they are more comfortable than many Western companies are with putting a new product or service into the market quickly and improving its performance through subsequent generations. It is common for products to launch in a fraction of the time that it would take in more developed markets. While the quality of these early versions may be variable, subsequent ones improve rapidly.<a href="#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Commercialization differs from <i>shanzhai</i>, or “copycat innovation.” Many executives in the developed world misunderstand <i>shanzhai</i>, believing that it is purely the replication of an innovation developed in another market. Although this does occur, products developed through the <i>shanzhai</i> approach incorporate features specifically for the Chinese market. <i>Shanzhai</i> is quite prevalent in consumer products categories such as packaged goods and electronics. It can also be found in the business-to-business domain, where local companies produce knockoffs of successful foreign products or business models. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span></p>
<p>Chinese companies also benefit from their government’s emphasis on indigenous innovation, underlined in the latest five-year plan. Chinese authorities view innovation as critical both to the domestic economy’s long-term health and to the global competitiveness of Chinese companies. China has already created the seeds of 22 Silicon Valley–like innovation hubs within the life sciences and biotech industries. In semiconductors, the government has been consolidating innovation clusters to create centers of manufacturing excellence.</p>
<p>But progress isn’t uniform across industries, and innovation capabilities vary significantly: several basic skills are at best nascent within a typical Chinese enterprise. Pain points include an absence of advanced techniques for understanding—analytically, not just intuitively—what customers really want, corporate cultures that don’t support risk taking, and a scarcity of the sort of internal collaboration that’s essential for developing new ideas.</p>

        <tr><td><p>
In innovative sectors such as biotechnology, electric vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and solar energy, the number of patent applications from Chinese companies is rising. In fact, Huawei and ZTE ranked among the world’s top five corporate patent registrants by volume in 2010. Intensifying patent activity reflects a growing recognition that intellectual property is essential to value. As this mentality takes hold, domestic innovators may pressure the government to create a more modern intellectual-property system.</p><p>
Currently, China recognizes three categories of patents: invention (what most people elsewhere think of as worthy of a patent), utility (a new use for something that already exists), and design. Invention patents run for 20 years, the others only for 10. Patent reform—such as reducing the duration of design or utility patents and raising the bar for what can be registered in those categories—would be a powerful way for the Chinese government to signal its seriousness about promoting indigenous innovation. If China decides to move ahead with patent reform, a desire for global consistency could well make it a high-priority multilateral issue.</p><p>Without patent reform, companies must rely on one of two strategies for protecting intellectual property. The first is to continue to outrun the competition by developing increasingly innovative solutions or building in protection through complex integration that is difficult to reverse-engineer. The second is to create easily identifiable technology “signatures” that would be hard to refute in legal proceedings.</p></td></tr>

<p>Multinationals are far stronger in these areas but face other challenges, such as high attrition among talented Chinese nationals that can slow efforts to create local innovation centers. Indeed, the contrasting capabilities of domestic and multinational players, along with the still-unsettled state of intellectual-property protection (see sidebar, “Improving the patent process”), create the potential for topsy-turvy competition, creative partnerships, and rapid change. This article seeks to lay out the current landscape for would-be innovators and to describe some of the priorities for domestic and multinational companies that hope to thrive in it.</p>
<h3>China’s innovation landscape</h3>
<p>Considerable innovation is occurring in China in both the business- to-consumer and business-to-business sectors. Although breakthroughs in either space generally go unrecognized by the broader global public, many multinational B2B competitors are acutely aware of the innovative strides the Chinese are making in sectors such as communications equipment and alternative energy. Interestingly, even as multinationals struggle to cope with Chinese innovation in some areas, they seem to be holding their own in others.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">The business-to-consumer visibility gap</h3>
<p>When European and US consumers think about what China makes, they reflexively turn to basic items such as textiles and toys, not necessarily the most innovative products and rarely associated with brand names.</p>
<p>In fact, though, much product innovation in China stays there. A visit to a shop of the Suning Appliance chain, the large Chinese consumer electronics retailer, is telling. There, you might find an Android-enabled television complete with an integrated Internet-browsing capability and preloaded apps that take users straight to some of the most popular Chinese Web sites and digital movie-streaming services. Even the picture quality and industrial design are comparable to those of high-end televisions from South Korean competitors.</p>
<p>We observe the same home-grown innovation in business models. Look, for example, at the online sector, especially Tencent’s QQ instant-messaging service and the Sina Corporation’s microblog, Weibo. These models, unique to China, are generating revenue and growing in ways that have not been duplicated anywhere in the world. QQ’s low, flat-rate pricing and active marketplace for online games generate tremendous value from hundreds of millions of Chinese users.</p>
<p>What’s keeping innovative products and business models confined to China? In general, its market is so large that domestic companies have little incentive to adapt successful products for sale abroad. In many cases, the skills and capabilities of these companies are oriented toward the domestic market, so even if they want to expand globally, they face high hurdles. Many senior executives, for example, are uncomfortable doing business outside their own geography and language. Furthermore, the success of many Chinese models depends on local resources—for example, lower-cost labor, inexpensive land, and access to capital or intellectual property—that are difficult to replicate elsewhere. Take the case of mobile handsets: most Chinese manufacturers would be subject to significant intellectual property–driven licensing fees if they sold their products outside China.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Successes in business to business</h3>
<p>Several Chinese B2B sectors are establishing a track record of innovation domestically and globally. The Chinese communications equipment industry, for instance, is a peer of developed-world companies in quality. Market acceptance has expanded well beyond the historical presence in emerging markets to include Europe’s most demanding customers, such as France Télécom and Vodafone.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals are another area where China has made big strides. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country was a bit player in the discovery of new chemical entities. By the next decade, however, China’s sophistication had grown dramatically. More than 20 chemical compounds discovered and developed in China are currently undergoing clinical trials.</p>

<p class="grayNote small">Workers produce solar-cell modules in a factory in China’s Jiangsu Province.<br>© Imaginechina/Corbis</p>
<p>China’s solar- and wind-power industries are also taking center stage. The country will become the world’s largest market for renewable-energy technology, and it already has some of the sector’s biggest companies, providing critical components for the industry globally. Chinese companies not only enjoy scale advantages but also, in the case of solar, use new manufacturing techniques to improve the efficiency of solar panels.</p>
<p>Success in B2B innovation has benefited greatly from friendly government policies, such as establishing market access barriers; influencing the nature of cross-border collaborations by setting intellectual-property requirements in electric vehicles, high-speed trains, and other segments; and creating domestic-purchasing policies that favor Chinese-made goods and services. Many view these policies as loading the dice in favor of Chinese companies, but multinationals should be prepared for their continued enforcement.</p>

<p>Despite recent setbacks, an interesting example of how the Chinese government has moved to build an industry comes from high-speed rail. Before 2004, China’s efforts to develop it had limited success. Since then, a mix of two policies—encouraging technology transfer from multinationals (in return for market access) and a coordinated R&D-investment effort—has helped China Railways’ high-speed trains to dominate the local industry. The multinationals’ revenue in this sector has remained largely unchanged since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country’s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What’s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have <i>not</i> been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Advantage, multinationals?</h3>
<p>Simultaneously, multinationals have been shaping China’s innovation landscape by leveraging global assets. Consider, for example, the joint venture between General Motors and the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, which adapted a US minivan (Buick’s GL8) for use in the Chinese market and more recently introduced a version developed in China, for China. The model has proved hugely popular among executives.</p>
<p>In fact, the market for vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines remains dominated by multinationals, despite significant incentives and encouragement from the Chinese government, which had hoped that some domestic automakers would emerge as leaders by now. The continued strength of multinationals indicates how hard it is to break through in industries with 40 or 50 years of intellectual capital. Transferring the skills needed to design and manufacture complex engineering systems has proved a significant challenge requiring mentorship, the right culture, and time.</p>
<p>We are seeing the emergence of similar challenges in electric vehicles, where early indications suggest that the balance is swinging toward the multinationals because of superior product quality. By relying less on purely indigenous innovation, China is trying to make sure the electric-vehicle story has an ending different from that of its telecommunications protocol efforts. The government’s stated aspiration of having more than five million plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles on the road by 2020 is heavily supported by a mix of extensive subsidies and tax incentives for local companies, combined with strict market access rules for foreign companies and the creation of new revenue pools through government and public fleet-purchase programs. But the subsidies and incentives may not be enough to overcome the technical challenges of learning to build these vehicles, particularly if multinationals decline to invest with local companies.</p>
<h3>Four priorities for innovators in China</h3>
<p>There’s no magic formula for innovation—and that goes doubly for China, where the challenges and opportunities facing domestic and multinational players are so different. Some of the priorities we describe here, such as instilling a culture of risk taking and learning, are more pressing for Chinese companies. Others, such as retaining local talent, may be harder for multinationals. Collectively, these priorities include some of the critical variables that will influence which companies lead China’s innovation revolution and how far it goes.</p>
<img alt="China high-speed train" src="~/media/McKinsey/dotcom/Insights/Asia-Pacific/A CEOs guide to innovation in China/ChinaTrain.ashx?mw=510">
<p class="grayNote small">A Chinese-built high-speed train at the Wuhan Railway Station, in Wuhan, China.<br>© Guo Xulei/Xinhua Press/Corbis</p><h3 class="sm black">Deeply understanding Chinese customers</h3>
<p>Alibaba’s Web-based trading platform, Taobao, is a great example of a product that emerged from deep insights into how customers were underserved and their inability to connect with suppliers, as well as a sophisticated understanding of the Chinese banking system. This dominant marketplace enables thousands of Chinese manufacturers to find and transact with potential customers directly. What looks like a straightforward eBay-like trading platform actually embeds numerous significant innovations to support these transactions, such as an ability to facilitate electronic fund transfers and to account for idiosyncrasies in the national banking system. Taobao wouldn’t have happened without Alibaba’s deep, analytically driven understanding of customers.</p>
<p>Few Chinese companies have the systematic ability to develop a deep understanding of customers’ problems. Domestic players have traditionally had a manufacturing-led focus on reapplying existing business models to deliver products for fast-growing markets. These “push” models will find it increasingly hard to unlock pockets of profitable growth. Shifting from delivery to creation requires more local research and development, as well as the nurturing of more market-driven organizations that can combine insights into detailed Chinese customer preferences with a clear sense of how the local business environment is evolving. Requirements include both research techniques relevant to China and people with the experience to draw out actionable customer insights.</p>
<p>Many multinationals have these capabilities, but unless they have been operating in China for some years, they may well lack the domestic-market knowledge or relationships needed to apply them effectively. The solution—building a true domestic Chinese presence rather than an outpost—sounds obvious, but it’s difficult to carry out without commitment from the top. Too many companies fail by using “fly over” management. But some multinationals appear to be investing the necessary resources; for example, we recently met (separately) with top executives of two big industrial companies who were being transferred from the West to run global R&D organizations from Shanghai. The idea is to be closer to Chinese customers and the network of institutions and universities from which multinationals source talent.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Retaining local talent</h3>
<p>China’s universities graduate more than 10,000 science PhDs each year, and increasing numbers of Chinese scientists working overseas are returning home. Multinationals in particular are struggling to tap this inflow of researchers and managers. A recent survey by the executive-recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles found that 77 percent of the senior executives from multinational companies responding say they have difficulty attracting managers in China, while 91 percent regard employee turnover as their top talent challenge.</p>
<p>Retention is more of an issue for multinationals than for domestic companies, but as big foreign players raise their game, so must local ones. Chinese companies, for example, excel at creating a community-like environment to build loyalty to the institution. That helps keep some employees in place when competing offers arise, but it may not always be enough.</p>
<p>Talented Chinese employees increasingly recognize the benefits of being associated with a well-known foreign brand and like the mentorship and training that foreign companies can provide. So multinationals that commit themselves to developing meaningful career paths for Chinese employees should have a chance in the growing fight with their Chinese competitors for R&D talent. Initiatives might include in-house training courses or apprenticeship programs, perhaps with local universities. General Motors sponsors projects in which professors and engineering departments at leading universities research issues of interest to the automaker. That helps it to develop closer relations with the institutions from which it recruits and to train students before they graduate.</p>
<p>Some multinationals energize Chinese engineers by shifting their roles from serving as capacity in a support of existing global programs to contributing significantly to new innovation thrusts, often aimed at the local market. This approach, increasingly common in the pharma industry, may hold lessons for other kinds of multinationals that have established R&D or innovation centers in China in recent years (read about AstraZeneca’s experience in “Three snapshots of Chinese innovation”). The keys to success include a clear objective— for instance, will activity support global programs or develop China-for-China innovations?—and a clear plan for attracting and retaining the talent needed to staff such centers. Too often, we visit impressive R&D facilities, stocked with the latest equipment, that are almost empty because staffing them has proved difficult.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Instilling a culture of risk taking</h3>
<p>Failure is a required element of innovation, but it isn’t the norm in China, where a culture of obedience and adherence to rules prevails in most companies. Breaking or even bending them is not expected and rarely tolerated. To combat these attitudes, companies must find ways to make initiative taking more acceptable and better rewarded.</p>
<p>One approach we found, in a leading solar company, was to transfer risk from individual innovators to teams. Shared accountability and community support made increased risk taking and experimentation safer. The company has used these “innovation work groups” to develop everything from more efficient battery technology to new manufacturing processes. Team-based approaches also have proved effective for some multinationals trying to stimulate initiative taking (read about General Motors’ approach in “Three snapshots of Chinese innovation”).</p>
<p>How fast a culture of innovation takes off varies by industry. We see a much more rapid evolution toward the approach of Western companies in the way Chinese high-tech enterprises learn from their customers and how they apply that learning to create new products made for China (read a perspective on the evolution of its semiconductor sector in “Thee snapshots of Chinese innovation”). That approach is much less common at state-owned enterprises, since they are held back by hierarchical, benchmark-driven cultures.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Promoting collaboration</h3>
<p>One area where multinationals currently have an edge is promoting collaboration and the internal collision of ideas, which can yield surprising new insights and business opportunities. In many Chinese companies, traditional organizational and cultural barriers inhibit such exchanges.</p>
<p>Although a lot of these companies have become more professional and adept at delivering products in large volumes, their ability to scale up an organization that can work collaboratively has not kept pace. Their rigorous, linear processes for bringing new products to market ensure rapid commercialization but create too many hand-offs where insights are lost and trade-offs for efficiency are promoted.</p>
<p>One Chinese consumer electronics company has repeatedly tried to improve the way it innovates. Senior management has called for new ideas and sponsored efforts to create new best-in-class processes, while junior engineers have designed high-quality prototypes. Yet the end result continues to be largely undifferentiated, incremental improvements. The biggest reason appears to be a lack of cross-company collaboration and a reliance on processes designed to build and reinforce scale in manufacturing. In effect, the technical and commercial sides of the business don’t cooperate in a way that would allow some potentially winning ideas to reach the market. As Chinese organizations mature, stories like this one may become rarer.</p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>China hasn’t yet experienced a true innovation revolution. It will need time to evolve from a country of incremental innovation based on technology transfers to one where breakthrough innovation is common. The government will play a powerful role in that process, but ultimately it will be the actions of domestic companies and multinationals that dictate the pace of change—and determine who leads it.</p>

Nowhere is this task more challenging than in the US Department of Defense (DoD), which is committed to transforming its business practices to support faster and more agile operations. This multiyear mission will touch all aspects of the DoD, which has annual net operating costs exceeding $620 billion—including more than $30 billion for technology—2.9 million people, and a supply chain involving 5.2 million items.</p>
<p>[[exhibit exhibit 3]]</p>
<p>
In 2005, the DoD established the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) to help guide transformation efforts throughout the department. The BTA’s responsibilities include deploying enterprise IT systems, publishing the Business Enterprise Architecture, and helping to carry out investment decisions. The agency, for example, oversees programs that manage pay and travel for the armed services, makes proposals to organizations such as the army and the navy (called “components” inside the Pentagon) about how they can transform themselves most effectively, and encourages standardization throughout the department.</p>

Few people have as good a position to reflect upon the DoD’s transformation as David Fisher, the BTA’s first official director. Fisher joined the DoD from Silicon Valley, where as a consultant he helped private-sector companies to implement large enterprise systems. As a special assistant to the deputy undersecretary of defense for financial management, Fisher helped guide an enterprise-level business transformation and served on the team that launched the BTA. McKinsey’s James Kaplan and Kreg Nichols met with him in his office, in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, DC, to discuss the differences between public- and private-sector transformations, as well as what he has learned about managing megaprojects.</p>

<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> Coming from Silicon Valley, how similar do you think the public and private sectors are?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> While the mission may be different, many of the business challenges are the same—for example, tracking supply chains or making certain that people are paid correctly and on time. But the public sector differs in some significant ways. For example, the scale is very different. The size and scope of the Department of Defense are challenging. The best way to think about our size is to take a look at our budget. In all, last year we had gross costs of over $600 billion, more than the sum of the revenues of, say, Wal-Mart, GE, and IBM. It’s enormous, and there’s nothing comparable to it in the private sector.</p>

<p>
Also, our leadership changes regularly—at least every eight years, when presidential administrations turn over, and generally more often. This is a challenge when you consider that huge organizations in the public and private sectors work at transformations for a long time, sometimes up to ten years, before really starting to reap the benefits. Paul Brinkley, the deputy undersecretary of defense for business transformation, reminds us that IBM was undergoing transformation for ten years before the company really started to reap the benefits of overhauling the supply chain, for example. Even in the best situations, transformations take a long time to accomplish. We look to commercial business for an indicative timeline, but you’d have to combine four or five of the Fortune 10 to get the scale of the DoD.</p>

<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> What have you been able to use from your commercial-sector experience?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> My experience working with large companies helped prepare me for this type of role by giving me a willingness to buck the cultural trend and to suggest new ways of doing business. The BTA has been trying to apply the best practices from the commercial world, especially about how we govern and manage IT investments. If there are processes that we can streamline to help programs deliver capabilities faster, without getting bogged down in some of the administrative activities, we try to do that.</p>

<p>
This can be hard to do in a complex, hierarchical environment like the Department of Defense. Fortunately, many people around me, who have more experience within the government culture, have proved to be tremendously valuable at identifying constraints we face in public projects—constraints that just wouldn’t be there in the private sector.</p>
<p>
The department has been trying to modernize the way it does business for a long time, and we still have a long way to go. Every administration tries, and I’m sure we make some progress each time. But on the whole, we’re not where we want to be—or where we need to be. We want to build on the good work that’s been done before us, but we also need to question previous actions that weren’t successful and to offer new solutions.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> What are the goals of your transformation efforts?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Our overall objective is to guide business transformation efforts at the enterprise level of the Department of Defense in order to improve the DoD’s ability to perform its mission. We do that sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. The BTA has a combination of operational and technical roles to play—for example, we manage the systems that handle travel and payroll for about 1.5 million employees of the DoD. But a big part of our role is to identify skill sets that are scattered throughout the DoD and unite them so that its components can work better together. For example, we bring the functional people and the technical people together so that a set of data standards affecting multiple areas can be agreed on.</p>
<p>
Successful coordination among the components doesn’t come from exercising authority but rather from exerting influence. People in the components don’t have to open the door to us, and I’m not empowered to make them open the door. But if I can demonstrate value, they’re going to open the door to me, whether I’m empowered or not. It’s all about adding value. There are certain things that we have authority for, but even in an environment where you have authority, your authority will only carry you so far in the effort to move things forward in a positive direction.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> What are the main challenges in deploying technology to support the transformation?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> We spend about $2 billion each year on IT business transformation, half of it on enterprise resource planning systems throughout the Department of Defense. Much of the work for these ERP systems focuses on deciding what should be centralized, at the DoD enterprise level, and what should be managed by components—the military services, defense agencies, combatant commands, and military health services. As in any large organization, the people at the enterprise level are consumers of information. As long as information in different systems can be aggregated in a standard way, these people can do their jobs. On the other hand, some decision making is distributed, occurring within organizations that make up the DoD. The challenge lies in the gray area. Where is it more effective to have a single system at the center as opposed to multiple versions that adhere to common standards?</p>
<p>
[video Sample Chaptered video]
We have 27 systems in our enterprise portfolio today, and many of these are centralized only because the components did not have the ability to run their own when these systems were implemented years ago. As the capabilities of the components mature, we must ask if there are more efficient and effective ways to complete those transactions while still providing the members of our cross-component community with the information they need to do their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> How do you manage such a large-scale transformation?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Much depends on governance and on discipline in setting and implementing standards. Consider our experience implementing a set of standards for financial data. Initially, the reaction in the field was that this would cost too much to embed in individual IT systems, so we came up with a two-pronged approach.</p>
<p>
In the short term, we agreed to create a bridge system to the components’ legacy accounting systems, to save costs. It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it moved us toward interoperable data at a relatively low cost in a short time frame. Our longer-term challenge involved integrating these standards into various ERP systems. It was critical to get this right, from the beginning. Again, the components’ managers were concerned that this would be expensive and difficult to integrate with their SAP and Oracle systems. So we deployed ERP experts among the components who worked with teams there to identify ways to configure the ERP systems so they could work with standardized data. It’s been very successful.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> How do you keep people motivated and set performance measures?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> When I left the commercial environment, I thought one of the great things about leaving was putting behind me the need to meet quarterly profit-and-loss targets and to deal with the short-term decision making that results from a quarterly focus. But now that I don’t have those constraints, I miss having the motivation to hit quarterly numbers. So you have to look for different kinds of motivators to keep projects on time.</p>
<p>
The people who go into public service are unbelievably passionate about what they do. There is a tangible internal motivation about doing public service that is different from what you find in the commercial marketplace. It’s not something you can necessarily put your finger on, but it’s real. We appreciate that. It’s very important. That said, we have to find ways to measure accountability. In the commercial world, there’s the P&L—you’re held accountable for the numbers. We are always in search of ways to hold people accountable, not least because if you succeed at something, you want to be recognized for it.</p>
<p>
We and the rest of the Defense Department have recently begun to move away from an old tenure-based performance model to a new system—the National Security Personnel System—that is closer to pay for performance. This is the type of system that’s familiar to commercial enterprises, but it’s new to this public environment, so we had to spend some time explaining that the goals had to be objective, measurable, time constrained. It’s been somewhat controversial because not everyone likes this shift. But as a manager, I have found it a positive shift, especially in terms of getting people to think about time. Sometimes, impatience is exactly right because within the public sector, things do tend to run on for a while. We need to build in that internal motivator that makes people ask, what did I get done today?</p>
<p>
In the end, however, while people care about their compensation, just as they should, it’s a small part of what motivates people here. It’s about the contribution to public service. One of the things that rallies the passion of these folks is seeing that they’re making a difference on a national security–related issue that helps the people on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> With such large-scale technology deployments, what have you learned about managing megaprojects?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Many of the things that would portend a successful ERP implementation of small to medium size would portend success for the large programs at the DoD. We’ve looked at the top reasons ERP implementations fail. Many failures come down to governance, change management, requirements management, customization, the skill sets of the people involved, and testing. Those concepts are immutable, regardless of size and scale. Our challenge with these immense projects is that implementation takes such a long time, spanning several generations of IT development. That can be problematic and leave an opportunity for endless analysis and debate.</p>
<p>
It’s also important to clarify what we’re trying to optimize, since one person’s definition of the enterprise may be different from another’s. From my perspective, the enterprise is the Department of Defense. But if I go to the army or navy, they might define the enterprise differently; if they’re trying to optimize the army or navy as opposed to the DoD, we end up with different solutions.</p>
<p>
Let me give you one example of how the BTA’s involvement helped the army reexamine the scope of some of its systems to good effect. The army had three big ERP systems—one that handled finance and two for logistics (a more tactical system for the front end and a more wholesale system for the back end). All three systems were operating fairly independently. Our observation was that, although these independent systems may be optimizing the parts, they were suboptimizing the whole in terms of business processes, management, and the utilization of technology.</p>
[video Sample Video]
<p>
Through some pretty heavy engagements—some well received, others not—we were able to demonstrate that there was a better way to use technology to reduce risks the army would face in the way the systems communicated, reconciled data, and otherwise performed together. We recommended that the army connect the three systems more closely because, for example, each of the logistics transactions was eventually going to be a financial transaction. If you look at things that way from the beginning, it fosters an environment where you look at the business from end to end. The army has now adopted some of those concepts and has a cross-domain governance model. So we got the conversation going and it’s had this positive impact. We weren’t empowered to do any of that by our authority. We were passionate about it, and we were able to convince the army to let us in on the dialogue and help them come to decisions that represented a change for the better.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> Any other big lessons to pass along?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Question every assumption. We often assume that we have to do something in a certain way because it’s the policy or the way we’ve done it before. Question that assumption, and if it doesn’t make sense, find out who owns the policy or who owns the way it was done before. Even laws change. Sometimes the answer is no, and that’s it. But if you have a case that helps everyone to agree that the old way doesn’t make sense and that there’s a better way, a transformational way, of doing things, question the old way.  </p>

Baily, Diana Farrell]]></dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the digital revolution and the dramatic fall in international telecommunications costs comes the prospect that white-collar jobs—once insulated from global competition—can be performed offshore, in low-wage nations such as India, where labor can be hired for as little as one-tenth its cost in the United States. Call-center agents, data processors, medical technicians, and software programmers could all find their jobs at risk from the nation's growing trade in services with emerging markets. In fact, offshoring is frequently blamed for the agonizingly slow pace of job growth in the United States, despite a recovering economy.</p>
<p>Even free traders have wavered in their beliefs. Critics warn that millions of people in the United States will become jobless. The response from Congress has been to include in a fiscal 2004 spending bill a provision prohibiting federal agencies from outsourcing some kinds of work to private companies that use workers in foreign countries. Indeed, 23 states are considering similar restrictions; 4 have already passed them. Jobs and trade have become the hot-button issues of the 2004 presidential election race.</p>
<p>The current debate is misplaced, however, because the problem is neither trade itself nor globalization more broadly but rather the question of how the country should allocate the benefits of global trade. Trade in services, like other forms of international trade, benefits the United States as a whole by making the economic pie bigger and raising the standard of living. Outsourcing jobs abroad can help keep companies profitable, thereby preserving other US jobs. The cost savings can be used to lower prices and to offer consumers new and better types of services. By raising productivity, offshoring enables companies to invest more in the next-generation technologies and business ideas that create new jobs. And with the world's most flexible and innovative economy, the United States is uniquely positioned to benefit from the trend. After all, despite a large overall trade deficit, the country has consistently run a surplus in its international trade in services.</p>

Baily, Diana Farrell]]></dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this essay, Martin Baily, a Senior Fellow at the Institute for International Economics and a Senior Advisor to the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), and Diana Farrell, Director, MGI, reflect on the current heated debate about offshoring and put the issue in perspective. The authors cite MGI research that demonstrates the sizeable benefits the US stands to gain from offshoring through corporate savings, additional exports, repatriated profits, greater productivity, and new jobs.</p>
<p>While free trade creates wealth and improves a nation's standard of living, not all groups reap the same benefits, particularly in the short term. The reality of the emerging global economy is that the workforce is experiencing higher turnover than ever before. The challenge is how to make that inevitable process less painful and share more of the wealth being created.</p>
<p>Baily and Farrell cite concrete options for political and business leaders to help workers make the transition. Developing countries on their end must open their economies to attain the full benefits that free trade makes possible. Case evidence from MGI's research demonstrates how developing countries benefit from foreign direct investment. By resisting further liberalization, developing economies risk missing out on tremendous growth opportunities. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>French employment 2020: Five priorities for action</title><description /><link>http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/employment_and_growth/french_employment_2020</link><guid>http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/employment_and_growth/french_employment_2020</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 08:30:46 GMT</pubDate><ID>12b93c6f-ac06-4ae5-967e-57001fd73d69</ID><category>Employment and growth</category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Eric Labaye, Charles Roxburgh, Clarisse Magnin, and Jan Mischke]]></dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France’s labor market has been relatively resilient in the face of the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and of the sovereign-debt crisis, which gathered full force last year. But unemployment has begun to rise again. Achieving a considerable boost to employment is now critical because it is difficult to see how, without reversing this decline, France can sustain a social safety net that is already under significant strain.</p>
<p>Until the 1990s, France was among Europe’s leading economies in per capita GDP. By 2010, however, the country had dropped to 11th out of the EU-15. Low labor force participation of seniors and young people, as well as high unemployment rates are the main drivers of this per capita GDP gap. </p>
<p>A report from the McKinsey Global Institute finds that to meet even moderate ambitions for employment and prosperity, France must create more than twice as many net new jobs annually as it did during the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Unless France acts, by 2020 it may face a shortfall of 2.2 million highly skilled workers, and 2.3 million low-skilled workers will be unable to find jobs. Addressing this intensifying structural mismatch of skills is required to increase employment.</p>

<p>Drawing on European best practices, the report recommends that France should set five priorities for its 2020 labor agenda:</p>
<ul class="bullListSep">
    <li>reform labor market conditions for seniors to increase their level of workforce participation </li>
    <li>boost the overall skills of students and workers and better adapt their skills to the knowledge economy’s market demands </li>
    <li>improve labor costs and the flexibility of the labor market </li>
    <li>support job-creating growth for the high- and low-skilled alike </li>
    <li>improve mechanisms to ensure that employment policies are effective and efficient </li>

In Europe and Japan, the elderly will come to account for more than 30 percent of the population during the same period. This transformation is about to create a new sense of urgency to get the most from every government dollar. Public services beyond health care and pensions for seniors will face epic squeezes, and officials will struggle to balance the needs of retirees and younger citizens while still holding taxes to politically acceptable levels. Boosting the government's performance will be an imperative no country can ignore.</p>
<p>To be sure, attempts have been made before. In the United States, former Vice President Al Gore's efforts to "reinvent government" in the early 1990s scored some successes. The administration of President George W. Bush has made efforts to reform civil service rules that inhibit some sensible management practices. The Government Accountability Office (formerly the General Accounting Office) has shown perennial leadership in prodding government departments to address their management challenges. In the United Kingdom, Peter Gershon's recent review of government efficiency1 has galvanized work to improve productivity across the public sector, with a target of £20 billion in savings by the end of 2008.</p>
<p>But veterans of reform efforts agree that they have barely begun to scratch the surface of the government's performance potential. One reason is that reforms take sustained attention—often rare when they become caught up in partisan or interest group politics. What's more, political cultures remain oriented to legislation, not to executing and managing programs. Few people make their name by improving the way government runs.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the coming era's extraordinary fiscal pressures will force leaders to overcome these obstacles. In the developed world, the state commands a large share of the economy, so improving the performance of government departments can generate hundreds of billions of dollars of value. Our experience working with public institutions in 50 countries has shown us that the opportunity, though hard to capture, is large enough to take some of the sting out of the hard choices that aging societies face. With the first baby boomers becoming eligible for retiree health and pension benefits in just a few years, there is no time to lose.</p>

Remes]]></dc:creator><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buoyed by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico in the 1990s was the bustling factory floor of the Americas. But since 2000, as China rose to assume that role, more than 270,000 Mexicans have lost assembly jobs, hundreds of factories have closed their doors, and Mexico's trade deficit with China has grown to more than $5 billion. The ubiquitous "Made in China" stamp, found on everything from toys to textiles to statues of Our Lady of Guadalupe, has become the incarnation of the single greatest perceived threat to Mexico's economic prosperity—and a symbol of the pitfalls of globalization.</p>
<p>Mexico's fears are not unique. China's economic surge and its entry into the World Trade Organization have sparked alarm across the developing world. In middle-income countries such as Brazil, Poland, Portugal, and South Korea, a rising standard of living makes their position as low-wage producers and exporters increasingly tenuous.</p>
<p>Rather than fixating on jobs lost to China, these countries should remember a fact of economic life: no place can remain the world's low-cost producer forever—even China will lose that title one day. Instead of trying to defend low-wage assembly jobs, Mexico and other middle-income countries should focus on creating jobs that add higher value. Only if more productive companies with higher-value-added activities replace less productive ones can middle-income economies continue down the development path. Even so, being part of the global economy requires these countries, like Lewis Carroll's Alice in Through the Looking Glass, to do a lot of running just to stay in the same place. Unfortunately, for too many of them the focus on China—and, more broadly, political rhetoric against globalization—are blocking reform efforts.</p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Blame China?</h3></p>
<p>To developing countries watching foreign investors head east, China's economic prowess might seem invincible, but history suggests otherwise. Only 20 years ago, for example, the United States was convinced that the superior business models and industrial policies of Germany and Japan would shutter every last domestic factory door. In the 1990s, the United States fretted about the threat from the high-tech industries of South Korea and Taiwan, while presidential candidates warned of the "giant sucking sound" made by the migration of jobs to Mexico under NAFTA. These days, the United States is more concerned about the effect of China's economy on its trade balance and employment rate.</p>
<p>Nearly all countries worry about jobs lost to others—a fact often exploited for political ends. The demagoguery obscures the fact that countries must evolve to meet the challenges presented by new competitors outside their borders.</p>
<p>Mexico is a case in point. Like most middle-income countries, it has grown more prosperous through freer trade and liberalization. Its average household income is now more than twice the level in China and other low-wage countries, and its manufacturing wage rates reflect this increasing prosperity. But the maquiladora assembly operations that line the US border—often the most visible face of Mexico's entry into the global economy—are only a small part of the cause. Since NAFTA came into effect, in 1994, the country has received upward of $170 billion in foreign direct investment—more than three times the amount that India attracted. Yet less than 15 percent of this investment has gone to the maquiladoras; the vast majority has been motivated by a desire to sell into Mexico's large domestic market, not to produce cheap goods for export. Our research shows that non-maquiladora investments have generated a wide range of benefits for Mexico's economy by creating jobs, boosting competition and productivity, lowering prices, and enhancing consumer choice. Consider the impact of foreign investment on Mexico's automobile market: consumers can now choose from dozens of models, compared with just a few of them before. In the retailing industry, the price of fresh food in Mexico City is 40 percent below its level in 1993, the year before NAFTA opened up the economy. The lesson for Mexico and for other countries where jobs are going offshore is this: don't overestimate the value of low-wage employment.</p>

<p></p>
<p>To understand how this might happen, MGI launched a research project that combines extensive sector analysis, interviews with human resource executives, a proprietary survey of 2,000 business leaders, and our own scenario analysis and modeling.</p>
<p>The research analyzes the causes of slow job creation in the period before the recession and during the recovery and the implications of these forces for future job growth. The research projects how the US labor force will evolve over the next ten years and creates different scenarios for job growth based on extensive analysis of sector trends. MGI's central finding is that a return to full employment will occur in only the most optimistic job-growth scenario. This will require not only a robust economic recovery but also a concerted effort to address other factors that impede employment, including growing gaps in skill and education.</p>
<p>The report offers a range of illustrative solutions based on lessons from US states and other countries that MGI hopes will add to the national conversation on jobs.</p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Findings include:</h3></p>
<p></p>
<ul class="bullListSep">
    <li>Recoveries are increasingly becoming "jobless" due to firm restructuring, skill and geographic mismatches between workers and jobs, and sharp decline in new start-ups.</li>
    <li>The US needs to create 21 million new jobs by 2020 to regain full employment—and only achieves this in our most optimistic job-growth scenario.</li>
    <li>The US workforce will continue to grow until 2020, but under current trends, many workers will not have the right skills for the available jobs. Technology is changing the nature of work: Jobs are being disaggregated into tasks, work is becoming virtual, and firms are relying on flexible labor (temporary, contract workers). These trends offer new opportunities for creating jobs in the United States, a trend that some companies do not fully appreciate.</li>
    <li>Progress in four dimensions will be essential for reviving the US job-creation machine: Develop the US workforce-skill to better match what employers are looking for; expand US workers' share of global economic growth by attracting foreign investment and spurring exports; revive the nation's spark by supporting emerging industries, ensuring more of them scale up in the United States, and reviving new business start-ups; and speed up regulatory decision-making that blocks business expansion and new investment. </li>
